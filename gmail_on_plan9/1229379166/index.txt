Gmail on Plan9

It is currently not possible to access Gmail POP via upasfs(4) by
doing something like:

! upas/fs -f /pops/pop.gmail.com

See [this message | http://9fans.net/archive/2005/12/164] for
details. That message provides a pointer to a "pop3get" program which
can be used to fetch messages and subsequently deliver them to a Plan
9 mailbox.

Gmail offers an IMAP interface, however, that works nicely for
upasfs(4). Something like:

! upas/fs -f /imaps/imap.gmail.com/user@gmail.com

will enable reading Gmail with Plan 9 mail tools.

In some circumstances, it may also be possible to use the Plan 9 mail
tools to send via Gmail. If you change the last line of
/mail/lib/remotemail to:

! exec /bin/upas/smtp -sa -u user@gmail.com -h $fd tcp!smtp.gmail.com!smtp $sender $*

This will, however, send all mail on the system as that Gmail user.
Also, if mail is ever queued for later delivery, the factotum visible
to cron will need the keys to authenticate to Gmail.

If you replace /sys/src/cmd/webfs/cookies.c with
/n/sources/contrib/fgb/cookies.c and rebuild webfs(4), it is possible
to use Gmail's "basic HTML" view in the abaco web browser (see [Web
browsers]).
