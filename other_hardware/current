#Plan 9 runs or has run on a variety of non-x86 hardware.
#
#AMD64
#
#The AMD64 compiler suite is now included in the distribution, but
#note that AMD64-specific library code and the like are not yet
#distributed. A minimal AMD64 CPU server kernel exists at the labs.
#
#ARM
#
#A CPU server kernel runs on Marvell's Sheevaplug, Guruplug (but not
#Guruplug Display yet) and Openrd-client, based on the Kirkwood SoC,
#and another runs on the IGEPv2 and Gumstix Overo, based on the TI
#OMAP3530 SoC. USB and flash memory don't yet work on the OMAP kernel
#due to lack of documentation. Plan 9 now also runs on the dual-core
#Compulab Trimslice.

#produced a port to the [TS/7200 |
#http://www.embeddedarm.com/epc/ts7200-spec-h.html] SBC. This card
#was then used as part of a Lunchbox cluster detailed in this [Linux
#Journal | http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8177] article.

#has ported Plan 9 to the [Raspberry Pi |
#http://www.raspberrypi.org]. Kernel source code is available in
#/n/sources/contrib/miller/rpi/sys/src/9/bcm, an SD card image of a
#stand-alone fossil file system is in
#/n/sources/contrib/miller/9pi.img.gz, and a kernel image, which can
#be used to boot a Pi as a terminal in a Plan 9 network, is in
#/n/sources/contrib/miller/9pi.

#HISTORIC PORTS
#
#PowerPC 405EP, 405GP, 440GX based on Inferno CerfCube 405 port. CPU
#server runs on Virtex 4 and 5 FPGAs; available upon request.
#
#One of the Blue Gene ports is available.
#
#Alcatel-Lucent use some [PowerPC cards internally |
#http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/bbaa850c4fdb43c1],
#the code for these has been left in the distribution to help others
#doing their own ports. Again, these are now quite old.
#
#IPengine - [Richard Miller |
#http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/1c69e204443a7b60]
#has done a port to the [IPengine |
#http://www.brightstareng.com/ine1.htm] from Brightstar.
#
#Alpha - Plan 9 ran on the DEC Alpha [PC164 |
#http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/a2d44306b0e52c83],
#it is also believed to have run on the LX164 and with some small
#modifications on the [500au |
#http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/af19766a4019be59].
#More recently a port was done to the Dec Personal Workstation,
#[sd550
#http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/e690ed5040ae91af]
#though with no graphics support. Only network boot is supported.
#These are old machines and ports.
#
#MIPS - The second edition supported various MIPS-based platforms,
#including several then-popular SGI machines. SGI has declined to
#allow the kernel source to be distributed (unlike the 2e Sun
#sources, which are available). Tim Wiess has discussed doing a
#modern port.
#
#iPaq (ARM) - A version for some iPaq models is also distributed; see
#[Installation on Ipaq], but iPaqs are now quite old.
#
#BeBox - Dr C H Forsyth did a port of the Second Edition to the
#BeBox; detailed info and an image of the system can be found in:
#[http://verso.terzarima.net/plan9/soft/bebox.html]
#
#PowerPC iMac - Some students at CMU worked on a port to the iMac
#with Professor David Eckhardt. Work on the port has (more or less)
#stopped. In its current state, the port uses OpenFirmware-based
#device drivers; significantly, it lacks one for ethernet. For more
#information, see [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~412/projects/9mac/] or
#contact Prof. Eckhardt.
#
#64-bit SPARC - Tim Newsham has ported the both the plan9 compiler
#and kernel to the [sparc64 |
#http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/0edf88f2d51eff12].
#The code for this port is available in /n/sources/contrib/newsham:
#! Supported Platforms
#!  - Sun Ultra2
#! 
#! Supported Hardware
#!  - HME 10/100 ethernet
#!  - HME/FAS366 SCSI
#!     - no booting from disk yet
#!     - no support for sunlabel disk labels
#!  - Z8530 uart serial port
#The code was last updated in April of 2005; some work is needed to
#bring it back in sync with the current kernel tree.
#
#32-bit SPARC - Chris Collins was updating the 2nd edition [sparc32 |
#http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/6fb5b04c4869836b]
#port to the 4th edition. These machines are now quite old and the
#sparc64 port seems a better bet.
#
#Next Cube - The second edition supported 68k-based Nextstations as
#terminals; this code has not been updated to the 4th edition.
#
#Vax 750 - The earliest file server port. The compiler binary was
#recently found but the source appears to have been lost in the mists
#of time.
#
#Hobbit - A CRISP CPU developed by AT&T, see the entry in the
#[Wikipedia | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Hobbit]
#
#Compilers also existed for several other architectures which are no
#longer distributed. Some, like those for the Intel i960 and AT&T
#3210 CPUs, where only ever used to program peripherals and thus
#where not extensively tested. Others, like the AMD 29000, were used
#for other projects, like ports of Inferno. See 8c(1) for the list of
#currently distributed compilers.
