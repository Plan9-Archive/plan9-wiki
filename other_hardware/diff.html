MIPS
-
The
second
edition
supported
various
MIPS-based
platforms,
including
several
then-popular
SGI
machines.
SGI
has
declined
to
allow
the
kernel
source
to
be
distributed
(unlike
the
2e
Sun
sources,
which
are
available).
Tim

discussed
doing
a
modern
port.

PowerPC
iMac
-
Some
students
at
CMU
worked
on
a
port
to
the
iMac
with
Professor
David
Eckhardt.
Work
on
the
port
has
(more
or
less)
stopped.
In
its
current
state,
the
port
uses
OpenFirmware-based
device
drivers;
significantly,
it
lacks
one
for
ethernet.
For
more
information,
see
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~412/projects/9mac/">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~412/projects/9mac/</a>

Tim
Newsham
has
ported
the
both
the
plan9
compiler
and
kernel
to
the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/0edf88f2d51eff12">sparc64</a>.
The
code
for
this
port
is
available
in
/n/sources/contrib/newsham:
<pre>
Supported Platforms
 - Sun Ultra2

Supported Hardware
 - HME 10/100 ethernet
 - HME/FAS366 SCSI
    - no booting from disk yet
    - no support for sunlabel disk labels
 - Z8530 uart serial port
</pre>
The
code
was
last
updated
in
April
of
2005;
some
work
is
needed
to
bring
it
back
in
sync
with
the
current
kernel
tree.

<p class='para'>
Compilers
also
existed
for
several
other
architectures
which
are
no
longer
distributed.
Some,
like
those
for
the
Intel
i960
and
AT&amp;T
3210
CPUs,
where
only
ever
used
to
program
peripherals
and
thus
where
not
extensively
tested.
Others,
like
the
AMD
29000,
were
used
for
other
projects,
like
ports
of
Inferno.
