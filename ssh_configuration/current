#Plan9's ssh client supports only the SSH v1 protocol, If you simply
#must have the V2 protocol, a port of OpenSSH exists (see [Contrib
#index]), or you can volunteer to finish the native SSH v2 client -
#work on which has stalled.
#
#If SSH v1 is ok you can use auth/raskeygen to create a key for
#yourself.
#
#Assuming the remote system is called unix:
#
#! auth/rsagen -t 'service=sshserve owner=*' > key
#! auth/rsa2ssh key | ssh unix 'cat >>.ssh/authorized_keys'
#! cat key >/mnt/factotum/ctl
#
#You may now want to use ipso(1) to install the key in your secstore.
#
#For more information see rsa(8)
