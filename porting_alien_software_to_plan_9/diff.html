</div><hr />Plan
9's
C
dialect
(for
the
most
part)
consists
of
a
less
sophisticated
pre-processor
and
a
few
extensions
to
the
language
proper.
The
extensions
are
described
briefly
on
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/2c"><i>2c</i>(1)</a>
man
page
and
in
more
detail
in
the
paper
"<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/comp">How
to
Use
the
Plan
9
C
Compiler</a>"
(/sys/doc/comp.ps).
<p class='para'>
Plan
9
also
includes
a
compatibility
subsystem
called
APE,
the
ANSI/POSIX
Environment,
which
includes
a
complete
ANSI
pre-preprocessor.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
biggest
differences
you're
likely
to
run
into
on
this
level
are
the
libraries.
Plan
9
provides
different
libraries
for
many
of
the
standard
functions.
And
obviously
many
things
-
such
as
networking
-
are
done
completely
differently.
Again,
APE
provides
the
ANSI/POSIX
libraries
and
many
common
extensions.
</p>

<p class='para'>
As
suggested
here
a
few
times
before,
APE
may
actually
be
a
more
exactly
conforming
ANSI/POSIX
environment
than
many
Unix
systems.
But
the
preferred
development
environment
is
still
Plan
9's
native
environment,
which
provides
access
to
the
native
libraries,
compiles
faster,
and
results
in
faster
executables.
Nearly
all
the
C
code
in
the
system
as
distributed
(gs
and
troff
are
the
only
exceptions
I
can
think
of)
are
written
in
Plan
9's
C
dialect.
</p>

<p class='para'>
As
far
as
other
languages,
people
have
ported
Perl,
Python,
and
MosML
with
some
success.
They
are
not
distributed
with
the
system,
but
see
the
links
at
the
bottom
of
this
page
for
pointers.
There
was
a
C++
compiler
in
the
2nd
edition,
but
not
in
the
3rd
edition.
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/rc"><i>rc</i>(1)</a>,
the
shell,
is
excellent,
with
many
improvements
over
the
Bourne
shell
that
make
it
well-suited
to
scripting.
If
you
_need_
it,
APE
provides
a
mostly-ksh
shell
(minus
the
editing
modes
and
history).
There's
also
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/awk"><i>awk</i>(1)</a>.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you're
doing
applications-level
work,
and
you're
willing
to
learn
something
new,
it'd
be
worth
your
time
to
learn
Limbo,
the
programming
language
in
Inferno.
Inferno
runs
on
Plan
9,
and
lots
of
other
platforms
too
(various
Unixes,
Win-32,
raw
hardware).
Limbo
is
a
new
language
in
the
C
lineage,
with
great
facilities
for
inter-process
communication,
multi-threaded,
multi-process
development,
and
a
very
nice
syntax.
Definitely
worth
your
investigation.
</p>

<p class='para'>
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/mk"><i>mk</i>(1)</a>
is
used
extensively
in
Plan
9
for
keeping
binaries
up
to
date
from
source.
Mk
is
described
in
more
detail
in
the
paper
"Maintaining
Files
on
Plan
9
with
Mk"
(/sys/doc/mk.ps).
Its
function
is
similar
to
make
(which,
again,
APE
provides),
but
it's
simpler
and,
consequently,
more
powerful.
The
paper
"Plan
9
Mkfiles"
gives
some
examples
of
how
mk
and
mkfiles
are
used
in
the
system.
For
an
example
of
using
mk
outside
of
its
normal
role
of
building
binaries,
see
/sys/doc/mkfile.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
common
development
environment
(in
the
IDE
sense
of
the
term)
is
acme,
a
sort
of
combination
shell,
windowing
system,
and
development
environment.
It's
described
in
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/acme"><i>acme</i>(1)</a>
man
page,
and
in
the
paper
"Acme:
A
User
Interface
for
Programmers"
(/sys/doc/acme/acme.ps).
Acme
is
available
in
both
the
Plan
9
and
Inferno
distributions.
The
name
of
the
paper
is
somewhat
misleading
-
it's
quite
useful
for
lots
of
non-programming
tasks,
as
well.
For
example,
my
preferred
email
client
runs
in
Acme,
and
I
use
Acme
as
my
text
editor.

Andrew
Pochinsky
partially
ported
SXM
to
Plan
9,
take
a
look
at
<a href="http://www.malgil.com/sxm/">http://www.malgil.com/sxm/</a>
There
are
still
missing
things
in
the
Plan
9
version,
the
most
conspicuous
being
the
lack
of
Unicode
support.
It
could
probably
be
fixed
without
changing
the
SXM
character
model,
though.
</p>

<p class='para'>
David
Gordon
Hogan
made
the
Plan
9
port
of
GCC
3.0(and
related
utilities)
available
to
the
public.
There
are
three
gzipped
tar
files:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
/n/sources/extra/gcc/gnubin.tgz
</li>

<li>
/n/sources/extra/gcc/ape.tgz
</li>

<li>
/n/sources/extra/gcc/gnusrc.tgz
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
first
one
should
be
unpacked
in
the
root
of
your
Plan
9
system
in
order
to
install
the
various
binaries,
libraries
etc
in
the
required
system
locations.
It's
386
only,
that's
all
that
works
at
this
stage.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
second
contains
the
sources
of
a
port
of
the
APE
libraries
which
works
with
GCC.
APE
is
distributed
under
the
terms
of
the
Plan
9
License.
It
should
be
unpacked
into
/sys/src/gnu/ape.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
third
archive
is
a
snapshot
of
the
sources
used
to
build
GCC
et
al.
It's
in
a
slightly
unkempt
state.
Consult
the
README
file
for
more
details.
It
should
be
unpacked
into
/sys/src/gnu.
GCC,
Binutils,
and
the
other
files
in
the
third
archive
are
distributed
in
accordance
with
the
GPL.

<p class='para'>

free time and my interest on the port is not consistent, so there is
nothing to show. So far I ported the most difficult parts of the HPI
(threads, locks and JNI). My current excuse are the restrictions of
the filenames. I am waiting for 9P2000 :)

The
<a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a>
Java
implementation
has
now
been
ported
to
Plan
9.
Kaffe
for
Plan
9
was
originally
created
by
the
Bela
Lugosi
team
as
part
of
their
undergraduate
studies
at
the
Helsinki
University
of
Technology.
In
addition
to
the
java
interpreter,
Kaffe
distribution
package
contains
a
just-in-time
compiler
implementation.
But
it
is
incomplete
and
not
fully
functional.
This
port
is
for
Intel
386
compliant
platforms
only.
