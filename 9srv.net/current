#9srv.net offers Plan 9 accounts to the public. All systems are
#provided on a best-effort basis. There are two stable (more or less)
#cpu servers; other cpu servers come and go.
#
#To request an account, send your real name, prefered user name,
#contact email address, contact phone number, and location to a at
#9srv dot net. You will receive back a message with a brief
#introduction to the system and your initial password (which you are
#requested to change immediately). While not required, you are highly
#encouraged to attach a picture of yourself suitable for use as a
#face(6) file. If you do pgp/gpg, optionally, include in your initial
#message a pointer to your public key and I'll encrypt the message
#containing your initial password; my key is available on the major
#public keyservers.
#
#The systems are currently located in Cleveland, Ohio, US. They're on
#a business-class DSL line, but it's fairly asymetric in what is
#usually the wrong direction for this sort of usage. Be gentle.
#
#9srv.net also runs the default server for [snip] and offers a public
#repository of faces (see "[adding_your_face]").
