9VX

9vx is essentially a port of the Plan 9 kernel to the [vx32 |
http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/vm/] user-mode virtualization
environment. A special kernel device (#Z) provides access to the
local file system, similar to Inferno's #U.

9vx was originally written by [rsc | Russ Cox]. A version of it is
included in the vx32 distribution. Users can run that version against
a full Plan 9 tree to get a very good emulation of Plan 9.

Note that since the entire system runs as the invoking user, some
things aren't quite right. For example, all file access is done as
the invoking user, not the Plan 9 user. Networking is also provided
by a stripped-down IP stack that passes through to the host OS's IP
stack, but only tcp and udp.

There are extensions to 9vx to provide it a raw ethernet device
(which it may then run a real Plan 9 IP stack above) and allow direct
access to raw disk devices, which allow it to use a real fossil (and
optionally venti) partition, instead of #Z. Search 9fans; Brian
Stuart did the later; dho and/or quanstro did the networking. When
you find good links, come back and put them here!
