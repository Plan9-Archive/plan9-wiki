Please
use
this
template
as
a
guide
for
information
you
send
in
any
project
application.
Unless
specifically
stated
otherwise,
all
information

is
required.
Ensuring
that
your

Students
are
encouraged
to
stop

#plan9-gsoc
on
Freenode
(<a href="../IRC">IRC</a>)
if
they've
got
questions,
or
to
mail

<a name="CONTACT_INFORMATION" /><h3>CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Name
and
Email:
Your
full
name
and
a
valid
email
address.
This
will
serve
as
our
initial
primary
method
of
communication,
so
please
make
sure
it
is
correct!
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Chat
and
Instant
Messaging:
Real-time
chat
is
free
(or
at
least
inexpensive)
and
is
a
great
way
to
stay
in
touch
with
mentors
and
others
throughout
the
course
of
the
summer.
For
example:
"dhobsd
on
AIM;
evildho
on
IRC
(freenode,
efnet)."
We
require
at
least
one
of
these,
and
strongly
encourage
participation
in
our
IRC
channel,
#plan9-gsoc
on
irc.freenode.net.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Phone
number:
We'll
only
use
this
after
exhausting
all
other
means
of
contact
(and
once
before
accepting
students,
to
verify
it).
Please
enter
a

you
attending?

<ul>

<li>
Location:
Where

<li>
Bio,

or
C.V.:
Help
us
get
to
know
you
better.
Tell
us
about
your
skills,
experience,
and
interest.
This
needn't
be
too
fancy,
but
some
information
on
what
you've
done
and
what
you're
interested
in
would
help
a
lot.

Code
Samples:
Summer
of
Code
projects
are
inherently
code-focused,
and
we'd
like
to
see
some
pointers
to
code
you've
written,
either
from
your
own
projects
or
projects
you've
contributed
to.
We're
especially
interested
in
things
which
help
us
see
why
you're
a
good
match
for
the
particular
project
you're
applying
for.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Interest
in
Plan
9:
Plan
9
has
lots
of
great
ideas,
but
they're
different
from
what
you
find
in
other
environments;
we
want
to
make
sure
you're
not
coming
in
expecting
Unix.
We'd
like
to
know
what
it
is
about
Plan
9
(or
related
technologies)
that
you
find
intriguing;
have
you
used
them
before?
Which
ones
(Plan
9,
Inferno,
v9fs,
etc)?
Have
you
read
the
papers?
</li>
</ul>

<a name="CODE_CHALLENGE" /><h3>CODE CHALLENGE</h3>

<p class='para'>
We
want
to
be
sure
you
understand
the
basics
of
Plan
9
concepts
and
coding.
Please
take
a
look
at
one
(or
more)
of
the
following
options
and
submit
your
solution
along
with
your
application.
If
you
need
any
clarification,
or
have
any
general
questions
on
any
of
these
topics,
please
feel
free
to
get
in

either
via

<ul>

<li>
Write
a
9p/styx
server
to
do
something
trivial.
Something
a
bit
more
involved
than
"Hello,
World",
but
it
needn't
be
anything
fancy.
Perform
rot-13
on
a
block
of
text,
or
fetch
and
return
the
weather,
for
example.

<ul>

Write
a
simple
Acme
client
that
does
something
interesting.
The
<a href="http://ipn.caerwyn.com/">Inferno

has
some
<a href="http://ipn.caerwyn.com/search/label/acme">interesting

<li>
Port
a
Unix
application
to
Plan

Either
pick
a

for
a

<li>
srvssh

a

The

<p class='para'>
Tell
us
about
the
specific
project
you'd
like
to
work
on.
If
you've
picked
something
from
our
ideas
page,
please
make
the
title
match
what's
on
that
page.
Regardless,
you
should
be
able
to
describe
the
project
in
your
own
words
(even
if
it's
just
to
show
us
you
understand
what
an
existing
idea
is
looking
for).
Especially
if
your
proposal
is
your
own
idea,
be
sure
to
include
enough
detail
so
that
we
understand
your
idea.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Do
*not*
copy

paste

from

page
verbatim.

<a name="SCHEDULE_/_TIMELINE" /><h3>SCHEDULE / TIMELINE</h3>

<p class='para'>
Part
of
effective
engineering
is
being
able
to
break
a
project
down
into
component
parts
and
evaluate
those.
Do
so:
tell
us
what
the
component
parts
of
your
project
are
and
build
a
schedule
for
them.
</p>

<p class='para'>
We'd
like
you
to
break
down
your
project
into
weekly
(or
smaller,
if
it
makes
sense)
milestones.
This
will
allow
you
to
get
a
great
feel
for
the
work
required
for
your
project,
and
will
give
everyone
involved
a
schedule
to
help
guide
project
planning
along
the
way.
It
will
also
help
us
evaluate
the
scope
and
complexity
of
your
project,
as
well
as
how
well-formed
your
idea
is.
</p>

<p class='para'>
We
understand
that
this
schedule
will
change
as
the
summer
goes
on,
based
on
experience
working
on
the
project
and
discussions
with
your
mentor.
The
objective
here
is
not
to
hold
you
rigidly
to
what
you
say
here,
but
rather
to
demonstrate
your
understanding
of
the
project.
</p>

<a name="AVAILABILITY" /><h3>AVAILABILITY</h3>

<p class='para'>
Summer
of
Code
is
a
significant
commitment.
If
selected,
you'll
be
undertaking
a
project
designed
to
fill
the
summer.
Please
tell
us
about
any
other
commitments
you
have
during
the
summer.
How
many
hours
per
week
are
you
prepared
to
dedicate
to
this?
Will
you
be
taking
courses,
as
well?
Working?
Any
vacation
time
planned?
This
should
already
be
included
in
your
proposed
schedule
above,
but
call
out
any
vacation,
late
start
or
other
such
exceptional
issues
explicitly
here.
</p>

<a name="MENTOR_COMMUNICATION" /><h3>MENTOR COMMUNICATION</h3>

<p class='para'>
Summer
of
Code
is
a
mentoring
arrangement,
and
communication
with
your
mentor
is
key.
Please
describe
your
expectations
for
communication
with
your
mentor.
Are
you
prepared
to
provide
progress
updates
at
least
a
few
times
a
week?
How
are
you
most
comfortable
communicating
(email,
blog,
IRC,
so
on)?
While
our
mentors
are
making
a
commitment
to
give
you
time
and
attention
over
the
summer,
"stuff
happens";
what
would
you
do
if
your
mentor
disappeared
for
a
week
during
the
summer?
</p>

<a name="OPTIONAL:_SUGGESTED_MENTOR" /><h3>OPTIONAL: SUGGESTED MENTOR</h3>

<p class='para'>
If
you've
spoken
to
someone
in
our
community
about
this
project,
and
they've
agreed
to
mentor
you
for
the
summer,
list
them
here.
This
is
optional,
but
is
particularly
valuable
if
you're
proposing
a
project
not
on
our
list.
If
it
is
on
our
ideas
list,
we
can
mostly
figure
this
out.
