<p class='para'>
There
is
nothing
magical
about
installing
Plan
9.
It's
just
a
matter
of
populating
a
Plan
9
file
system
(typically
a
fossil
file
system)
and
arranging
a
bootstrap
to
eventually
load
a
Plan
9
kernel
that
can
use
that
file
system
as
its
root.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Once
that
initial
file
server
is
running,
enabling
authentication
and
pxe
booting
(bootp
and
tftp)
will
allow
all
other
local
Plan
9
systems
to
load
kernels
from
the
file
server
and
share
its
file
system.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
find
yourself
reinstalling
Plan
9
frequently,
something
is
wrong.
This
should
not
be
necessary.
In
particular,
there
is
no
need
to
give
each
Plan
9
system
its
own
file
system.

<p class='para'>
(NOTE
on
vmware
fusion
for
Mac
OS
X,
you
probably
want
to
use
SCSI
disks
as
the
IDE
emulation
makes
Plan
9
difficult
to
boot
at
this
time.
SCSI

the
other

works
VERY
fast
for
booting
and
installtion)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Cold
boot
(power
off,
power
on)
your
machine
using
your
CD.
You
will
be
given
the
choice
of
installing
Plan
9
or
just
booting
a
full
Plan
9
system
directly
from
the
CD.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Booting
the
system
directly
lets
you
explore
the
system
without
installing
and
also
makes
a
good
recovery
CD.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
installer
on
the
CD
assumes
that
your
CD-ROM
is
on
the
second
IDE
master.
If
your
CD-ROM
is
elsewhere,
you
will
see
the
following
error:
<pre>
Unknown boot device: sdD0!cdboot!9pcflop.gz
Boot device: fd0

</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
IDE/ATAPI
drives
in
Plan
9
are
named
like
sdD0,
where
the
capital
letter
is
C
for
the
primary
IDE
interface
and
D
for
the
second.
The
digit
is
0
for
the
master
and
1
for
the
slave.
So
if
your
CD-ROM
is
the
primary
slave,
use
sdC1:
</p>

<pre>
boot from: sdC1!cdboot!9pcflop.gz
</pre>

<p class='para'>
If
you
find
yourself
at
a
"boot

prompt
or
a
"root

it
is
likely
that
the
bootstrap
program
has
not
detected
your
floppy
drive.
See
<a href="../../installation_troubleshooting">installation

</p>

<p class='para'>
You
will

if
you
had
problems
during
the
installation
with
DMA
enabled.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You
will
be
prompted
for
a
"mouseport";
if
you
have
a
USB
mouse
ignore
this

but
that
should
be
OK.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Last
you
will
be
asked
for
your
vga

the

is
the
safest

</p>

<p class='para'>
Interaction
with
the
installation
program
is
textual
and
you
don't
need
to
interact
with
rio
during
the
install

For
systems
with

you
may
find
necessary
to

<p class='para'>
(Partdisk)
First

If
you
want
to
boot
Plan

directly
or
via
a
boot
loader
like
LILO
or
the
Windows
boot

you
need
to
allocate
a

or
from
DOS
via
ld.com
(see

<p class='para'>
Once
you
have
chosen
the
disk,
you
will
need
to
create
a
Plan
9
partition.
To
do
this,
the
install
process
will
run
the
Plan
9
fdisk
program
and
let
you
partition
the
disk.
If
the
disk
does
not
already
have
a
Plan
9
partition,
fdisk
will
suggest
one
by
creating
(but
not
writing)
a
partition
in
the
largest
contiguous
empty
space
it
can
find.
For
example,
you
might
see:
</p>

</p>

<p class='para'>
Fdisk
also
shows
the

include
the

&gt;&gt;&gt;
is
the
prompt.
Typing
h
or
?
at
this
prompt
will
print
the
help
message.
In
this
example,
the
*
next
to
p1
means
that
p1
is
the
active
partition
(i.e.
the
one
used
when
booting
from
the
disk),
and
the
single
quote
(')
next
to
p2
means
that
the
partition
table
entry
for
p2
is
different
from
what
is
on
the
disk;
that
is,
changes
have
been
made
but
not
written.
In
this
example,
fdisk
has
created
p2
in
what
was
previously
unpartitioned
space.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
agree
with
fdisks'
proposal,
you
need
only
type
w
to
write
the
changes
and
then
q
to
quit

Otherwise,
you

(Mountdist)
If
you
downloaded
the
archive,
the
install
program
has
written
it
to
/dist
on
your
chosen
partition.
The
install
program
will
run
mountdist
with
this
information
for
you,
so
you
can
skip
to
the
next
step.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Otherwise,
mountdist
presents
you
with
a
list
of
FAT
(DOS,
Windows),
ISO-9660
(CD-ROM),
and
Plan
9
file
systems
that
it
can
read.
You
must
choose
a
file
system
and
then
point
out
the
directory
containing
the
archive.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
archive
may
be
in
one
of
three
forms:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
A
bzipped
CD
image
named
plan9.iso.bz2.
This
is
the
file
you
obtain
from
the
download
page
on
the
Bell
Labs
server.
</li>

<li>
A
CD
image
named
plan9.iso.
This
is
the
result
of
uncompressing
plan9.iso.bz2.
If
you
store
the
uncompressed
image
on
a
FAT
file
system
beforehand,
then
the
install
program
will
not
need
to
uncompress
it,
which
will
save
disk
space
on
the
file
system.
</li>

<li>
The
contents
of
the
CD
image,
in
a
directory
tree.
This
is
the
CD
image
itself,
typically
written
to
a
CD.
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
When
prompted
for
"Distribution
disk"
the
usual
value
is
/dev/sdD0/data
(but
your
CD
drive
may
be
a
different
sdXX).
</p>

<p class='para'>
Once
you
have
chosen
a
file
system,
you
need
to
point
out
the
directory
containing
the
archive.
Type
a
slash-separated
path
name
relative
to
the
root
of
the
chosen
file
system.
If
you
type
``browse''
instead
of
a
directory
name,
you
will
be
dropped
into
a
minimal
shell
that
you
can
use
to
find
the
files.
Specifically,
the
shell
has
three
commands:
``cd
dir'';
changes
directories,
``lc'';
prints
a
columnated
list
of
files
for
the
current
directory,
and
``exit''.
Once
you
are
in
the
directory
containing
the
archive
(or
if
you
give
up
the
search),
exit
the
shell.

<a name="FORMAT_VENTI_(OPTIONAL)" /><h3>FORMAT VENTI (OPTIONAL)</h3>

<p class='para'>
(fmtventi)
If
you
selected
fossil+venti
you
will
now
be
prompted
for
the
arenas
and
index
(isect)
partitions
usually
created
during
the
'prepdisk'
step,
in
that
case
the
default
values
should
be
all
you
need.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
this
step
can
take
a
long
time
with
slow
disks
or
qemu.
</p>

<a name="COPY_THE_ARCHIVE_TO_THE_FILE_SYSTEM" /><h3>COPY THE ARCHIVE TO THE FILE SYSTEM</h3>

<p class='para'>
(Copydist)
Once
the
archive
has
been
located
or
downloaded,
selecting
unpack
will
extract
the
distribution
archive
to
the
newly
created
fossil
file
system.
The
log
window
will
display
the
name
and
size
of
each
file
as
it
is
extracted.
This
takes
anywhere
from
10
minutes
to
an
hour
depending
on
the
speed
of
your
computer
and
disks.

<a name="CONFIGURE_ONE_OR_MORE_WAYS_TO_BOOT_PLAN_9" /><h3>CONFIGURE ONE OR MORE WAYS TO BOOT PLAN 9</h3>

<p class='para'>
(Bootsetup)
The
first
time
you
run
bootsetup,
it
initializes
the
9fat
configuration
partition
with
the
appropriate
bootstrap
code
as
well
as
a
modified
version
of
your
plan9.ini
from
the
boot
floppy
or
CD
and
a
9pcf
kernel.
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
order
to
boot
into
Plan
9,
another
bootstrap
program
must
locate
this
partition,
read
plan9.ini,
and
boot
the
kernel.
There
are
a
number
of
ways
to
make
this
happen,
all
selectable
from
the
bootsetup
menu.
If
you
wish
to
use
more
than
one
method,
simply
run
bootsetup
multiple
times.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
boot
methods
are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
floppy.
Create
a
boot
floppy.
In
addition
to
a
bootstrap
program,
the
floppy
will
contain
a
kernel
and
a
backup
of
your
plan9.ini
file
named
plan9ini.bak,
but
will
not
use
them.
Instead,
the
floppy
will
load
plan9.ini
and
the
kernel
from
your
9fat
partition.
To
boot
the
kernel
on
the
floppy
(useful
as
a
rescue
mechanism
if
you
trash
your
9fat
partition),
copy
plan9ini.bak
to
plan9.ini
and
change
the
line
bootfile=sdXX!9fat!9pcdisk
to
bootfile=fd0!9pcdisk.gz.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
plan9.
Set
the
Plan
9
partition
to
be
the
active
one
(i.e.
the
partition
booted
by
default).
This
is
only
useful
if
you
have
installed
Plan
9
on
your
first
hard
disk
(for
IDE
systems,
sdC0).
You
can
always
set
another
partition
active
later
by
using
disk/fdisk.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
win9x.
Edit
the
Windows
startup
menu
to
list
Plan
9
as
an
option.
Your
c:\config.sys
and
c:\autoexec.bat
files
will
be
saved
as
config.p9
and
autoexec.p9,
and
then
edited.
A
bootstrap
program
as
well
as
plan9ini.bak
and
a
kernel
will
be
copied
to
the
directory
c:\plan9
(created
if
necessary).
The
procedure
described
above
for
rescue
works
here
too,
but
the
bootfile
should
become
sdC0!dos!plan9/9pcdisk.
This
may
or
may
not
work
with
Windows
Me.
We
have
not
tried
it.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
winnt.
Edit
the
Windows
NT/2000/XP
boot
menu
to
list
Plan
9
as
an
option.
This
is
only
possible
when
your
``c:''
drive
is
a
FAT
partition,
since
the
boot
configuration
must
be
accessible.
Your
c:\boot.ini
file
will
be
saved
as
boot.p9,
and
then
edited.
This
will
also
create
the
file
c:\bootsect.p9,
which
the
boot
manager
will
use
to
load
Plan
9.
