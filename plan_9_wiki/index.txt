Plan 9 Wiki


PLAN 9 FROM BELL LABS

Initially developed by the people who devised Unix at Bell Labs, Plan
9 took OS development back into the realm of research. Plan 9
development continues to challenge the concept of the operating
system, reworking the whole idea using modern concepts and technology.

Plan 9 is not Unix. If you think of it as Unix, you may become
frustrated when something doesn't exist or when it works differently
than you expected. If you think of it as Plan 9, however, you'll find
that most of it works very smoothly, and that there are some truly
neat ideas that make things much cleaner than you have seen before.

Plan 9 is applying to [GSoC]!
