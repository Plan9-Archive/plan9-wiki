</div><hr />Rio
is
the
Plan
9
window
system.
<p class='para'>
To
effectively
use
rio,
you
need
at
least
a
three
button
mouse.
If
you
only
have
a
two
button
mouse
you
can
emulate
the
middle
button
by
holding
down
shift
key
whilst
pressing
the
right
button.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Button
1,
2,
and
3
are
used
to
refer
to
the
left,
middle,
and
right
buttons
respectively.
</p>

<a name="THE_POP-UP_MENU" /><h3>THE POP-UP MENU</h3>

<p class='para'>
Pressing
and
holding
down
button
3
on
the
desktop
or
shell
window
will
give
you
a
menu
with
the
following
options:
<ul>

<li>
New
</li>

<li>
Resize
</li>

<li>
Move
</li>

<li>
Delete
</li>

<li>
Hide
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p class='para'>
You
select
an
item
by
releasing
the
button
over
the
menu
item.
rio
uses
the
same
button
that
started
an
action
throughout
that
operation.
If
you
press
another
button
during
the
action
the
operation
is
aborted
and
any
intermediate
changes
are
reversed.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
menu
acts
as
a
action
verb
selector
which
then
requires
an
object
(i.e.
window)
to
be
picked
to
indicate
which
window
the
verb
is
to
act
on.
A
further
mouse
action
may
then
be
required.
</p>

<a name="EXAMPLES" /><h3>EXAMPLES</h3>

<p class='para'>
After
selecting
New,
the
cursor
will
change
into
a
cross.
Using
button
3
again,
you
should
then
drag
out
a
rectangle
to
indicate
the
size
and
location
of
the
new
window.
When
you
release
the
button
a
new
window
will
be
created.
</p>

<p class='para'>
New
windows
will
contain
the
rc
shell.
Invoking
a
rio
program
from
the
shell
will
allow
that
program
to
take
over
the
window.
As
there
is
no
job
control
in
the
shell
(e.g.
&amp;,
fg,
bg),
you
just
create
another
window
if
you
want
to
run
another
program
concurrently.
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
Resize
a
window,
you
select
Resize,
then
click
(remember
using
the
same
button
that
started
the
action,
i.e.
button
3)
on
the
window
you
want
to
resize.
The
cursor
will
change
to
a
cross-hair
that
will
allow
you
to
drag
out
the
desired
shape
of
the
window.
</p>

<p class='para'>
After
selecting
Move,
click
and
keep
the
button
depressed
over
the
window
you
want
to
move,
then
move
the
mouse
to
move
the
red
rectangle
that
represents
the
new
location
you
want.
Release
the
button
to
finish
the
action.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Delete
and
Hide
both
operate
by
requiring
you
to
click
on
the
window
you
wish
to
respectively
Delete
or
Hide.
</p>

<a name="WINDOW_CONTROL_TIPS" /><h3>WINDOW CONTROL TIPS</h3>

<p class='para'>
Clicking
on
a
window
brings
it
to
the
front.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You
can
directly
change
the
shape
of
a
window
by
clicking
and
dragging
on
the
edge
or
corner
of
the
window
border.
Button
1
or
2
will
allow
you
to
drag
the
edge
or
corner
to
a
new
size,
and
Button
3
will
allow
you
to
move
the
window.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
pop-up
menu
remembers
the
last
command
chosen,
so
as
a
short
cut
you
can
just
press
and
release
button
3
without
moving
the
mouse
between
pressing
and
releasing
to
select
the
previous
command
again.
</p>

<a name="BASIC_TEXT_CONTROL" /><h3>BASIC TEXT CONTROL</h3>

<p class='para'>
Unlike
in
other
systems,
the
text
cursor
can
only
be
controlled
by
the
mouse
or
the
side-effects
of
certain
commands.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Clicking
with
button
1
will
move
the
text
insertion
point
(indicated
by
an
I-beam)
to
just
before
the
character
closest
to
the
mouse
pointer.
Dragging
across
a
section
of
text
will
select
that
portion
of
text.
It
may
be
useful
to
know
that
the
insertion
I-beam
represents
an
empty
selection
(between
two
characters).
In
text
editors,
the
current
selection
is
known
as
the
"dot".
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
the
shell
window
button
2
will
invoke
a
pop-up
menu.
Most
of
its
commands
operate
on
the
dot.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
cut
-
moves
the
contents
of
the
dot
to
the
clipboard
if
the
dot
is
non-empty
</li>

<li>
paste
-
replaces
the
dot
with
the
contents
of
the
clipboard
</li>

<li>
snarf
-
copies
the
dot
to
the
clipboard
</li>

<li>
plumb
-
sends
the
text
near
the
dot
to
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/Using_plumbing">plumber</a>
</li>

<li>
send
-
completes
the
current
command-line
with
the
dot
if
it
is
non-empty,
or
the
contents
of
the
clipboard.
If
the
dot
is
non-empty
it
does
a
snarf
at
the
same
time.
</li>

<li>
scroll
-
toggles
the
automatic
scrolling
behaviour
of
the
shell
window
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Double-clicking
will
allow
you
to
automatically
select
a
section
of
text
surrounding
that
point.
The
selection
is
made
by
an
analysis
of
appropriate
delimiters.
A
whole
line
is
selected
by
double-clicking
at
either
end
of
the
line.
A
quoted
or
bracketed
selection
is
made
by
double-clicking
just
inside
of
the
quote
or
bracket.
</p>

<a name="SCROLLING" /><h3>SCROLLING</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
arrow
keys
will
let
you
scroll
up
or
down
by
half
a
page
at
a
time.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Clicking
button
1
on
the
scrollbar
scrolls
up
by
bringing
the
line
at
the
top
of
the
window
to
your
mouse
cursor
position.
Button
3
scrolls
down
by
bringing
the
line
at
your
mouse
cursor
position
to
the
top
of
the
window.
Button
2
jumps
to
position
in
the
document
relative
to
the
position
on
the
scrollbar
clicked.
Holding
a
button
on
the
scrollbar
will
have
the
effect
of
invoking
the
clicking
action
continuously.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
white
elevator
box
on
the
scrollbar
is
sized
proportionally
to
the
area
of
the
document
that
is
currently
visible.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Scrolling
does
not
affect
the
text
cursor.
</p>

<a name="RIO_AND_THE_RC_SHELL_WINDOW" /><h3>RIO AND THE RC SHELL WINDOW</h3>

<p class='para'>
Rc
is
a
command
interpreter
for
Plan
9
that
provides
similar
facilities
to
UNIX's
Bourne
shell.
See
the
additional
references
at
the
end
of
this
document
for
information
specifically
about
rc.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Rio
provides
some
additional
features
that
enhance
the
interface
to
programs
that
use
the
text
console.
The
rc
shell
command
interpreter
is
one
such
program.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Rc
commands
are
typed
after
the
prompt
on
the
last
line
of
the
text
buffer.
The
commands
are
sent
to
rc
only
after
each
newline
so
line
editing
may
be
performed
if
desired.
You
can
move
the
cursor
and
edit
the
previous
lines
of
commands
and
program
output
but
none
of
this
will
be
interpreted
by
rc
shell.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
interpretation
of
commands
is
supressed
altogether
when
ESC
is
pressed
to
put
the
window
in
hold
mode.
The
window
border
and
text
will
change
to
dark
blue
to
indicate
that
the
hold
mode
is
active.
In
this
mode
you
can
type
multiple
lines
of
commands
and
edit
them.
Pressing
ESC
again
will
release
the
hold
mode
and
send
the
lines
of
text
to
the
rc
command
interpreter.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
DEL
key
sends
an
'interrupt'
note
to
all
processes
in
the
window's
process
group.
The
usual
intent
is
to
terminate
the
execution
of
the
current
command.
It
is
also
a
convenient
short
cut
for
ensuring
you
have
a
fresh
command
prompt.
