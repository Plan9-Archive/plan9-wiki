Troubleshooting Plan9 & lilo

If you're trying to boot plan9 from lilo and you get the following
message:

! Loading <imagename>
! PBS...Bad format or I/O error
! Press a key to reboot

... then this might help.

Boot from your install floppy. When the system comes up, open a shell
window by using the right mouse button against the rio backdrop. At
the command prompt, type the mount line that is listed in the
"status" window below your install command interpreter window. This
will mount your hard disk at /n/kfs.

Now, do the following:

! term% cd /n/kfs/386
! term% /n/kfs/rc/bin/9fat:
! term% cp /n/9fat/plan9.ini .
! term% unmount /n/9fat
! term% disk/format -b ./pbslba -d -r 2 /dev/$DISK/9fat ./9load ./9pcdisk ./plan9.ini

... where $DISK is your system media; mine is sdC0. The mount command
you gave before should give you a clue.

Reboot.
