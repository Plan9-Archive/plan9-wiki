Plan
9
and
related
technologies
cover
a
huge
range
of
topics.
Below
we've
put
together
a
list
of
some
ideas
which
we
think
would
be
good
candidates
for
stundents
looking
for
summer-sized
projects
with
us.
Each
idea
includes
at
least
a
brief
description
and
a
list
of
"sponsors"
for
the
idea
(people
who've
suggested
it
or
volunteered
to
work
with
folks
on
it).
Ideas
are
rated
for
estimated
difficulty
from
1
to
5
stars
(1=easy,
5=hard)
and
may
contain
links
to
further
information
or
discussion.
<p class='para'>
Note!
We
actively
encourage
students
to
submit
applications
for
projects
not
on
this
list,
too.
We've
accepted
such
projects
most
of
the
years
we've
participated.
Plan
9
(and
its
cousins)
embody
a
different
way
of
approaching
problems,
and
we
get
most
excited
when
we
see
a
student
(or
anyone,
for
that
matter)
apply
those
ideas
to
their
own
set
of
problems.
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
addition
to
this
ideas
page,
prospective
students
should
look

quite

The
Raspberry
Pi
port,
initially
done
by
Richard
Miller,
has
proven
a
very
popular
platform
for
Plan
9.
It
works
well,
but
there
is
more
that
could
be
done
with
the
hardware.
We
don't
have
any
audio
support,
for
example,
and
more
could
be
done
with
the
video

If
you
want

go
a
bit
farther
afield,
we're
not
doing
anything
with
the
DSI
or
CSI
connectors
(nobody
really
is),
although
that'd
involve
getting
the
right

It

Let's
pull
it
out
of
the
attic,
dust
it
off,
and
set
to
work
improving
it
(it
has
got
a
bugs
list).
There
are
many
possible
directions,
which
can
depend
on
the
interest
and
experience
of
the
student;
an
obvious
one
is
adding
caching
to
improve
performance.
One
application
would
be
to
provide
archival
storage
for
(say)
Raspberry
Pi
running
Plan
9,
or
an
Inferno
system
with
a
Venti
client.

Ventilator
✪✪✪✪
(Charles

</ul>

<p class='para'>
Venti
is
a
Plan
9
archival
data
service.
It
would
be
useful
for
Inferno
to
have
a
simple
file
system
implementation
that
uses
an
existing
Venti
for
its
archive
and
initial
state.
It
would
have
a
basic,
straightforward
implementation.
Some
might
say
naive,
but
Plan
9's
own
Fossil
is
fairly
complicated,
at
least
for
a
summer
project,
and
in
retrospect
has
some
limitations.
It
could
store
or
cache
file
system
metadata
and
data
locally
(and
optionally
separately).
It
would
allow
disconnected
operation.
It
could
be
fairly
slow
(raw
performance
doesn't
matter
at
this
stage).

9p
on

Yun
✪✪✪
(Skip
Tavakkolian)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
Arduino
Yun
is
sort
of
two
systems
in
one:
a
MIPS-based
linux
system
with
a
more-or-less
traditional
Arduino
on
the
same
board.
It's
a
good
platform
for
experimentation.
Write
a
9p
driver
that
exposes
the
Arduino's
capabilities,
such
as
access
to
the
pins,
and
write
some
sample
applications.
This
project
gets
the
extra
fun
of
defining
the
interface
method,
since
there
isn't
something
specific
the
student
needs
to
try
and
match.
Doing
this
on
top
of
the
existing
Linux
installation
will
be
the
easiest
route;
the
more
ambitious
option
would
be
to
replace
the
Linux
installation
outright
with
a
Plan
9
installation.

Access
to
more
host
devices
and
subsystems
for
Inferno
✪✪-✪✪✪✪
(Charles
Forsyth)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Hosted
Inferno
has
been
used
to
build
portable
applications,
especially
distributed
ones,
but
it
is
limited
in
its
support
for
host
devices.
Different
systems
often
have
rather
different
APIs
to
access
media
devices,
for
instance.
This
project
would
pick
one
or
two
of
the
more
eccentric
devices
from
the
hosted
system
-
ie.
video
(from
camera
and/or
video
capture),
tablet/pen
controls
w/pressure
sensitivity,
3D
mice,
etc.;
write
separate
host
programs
that
serve
a
name
space
using
9P;
and
then
write
Inferno
applications
to
use
them.
In
an
object-oriented
fashion,
there
could
be
different
instances
of
this
project,
with
students
working
on
interfaces
for
different
target
devices.
There
might
be
relevant
components
in
