usb-wifi


PROJECT STATEMENT

While many laptops these days come with embedded wireless hardware,
compatibility is a crapshoot. Meanwhile, affordable USB WiFi adaptors
exist. For example, there is an OpenBSD driver for the TEW-429UB, so
it should be possible to get that working.

Note that on Plan 9 a USB device driver is typically a user-space
program (i.e., this project will not require kernel development).
