#The Plan 9 web server httpd(8) has some interesting features. It
#also kept me scratching my head all day getting it going so I
#thought I'd share a few things.
#
#When the httpd runs it sets itself to user "none" and runs newns(2)
#and then addns(2) using the namespace provided on the command line
#(or /lib/namespace.httpd if you didn't give it a -n). This means
#that whatever you supply for the namespace file has to exist in the
#new namespace. ip/httpd/httpd -n /cfg/$sysname/namespace.httpd was
#my solution.
#
#While experimenting I had the problem of how to kill a process owned
#by none, here's how to do it :
#
#! p = `{ps | grep httpd}
#! chmod 777 /proc/$p(2) ^/note && echo kill > /proc/$p(2) ^/note
#
#I'm assuming only one program called httpd is running, of course.
#
#For extra fun ip/httpd/mirror was missing from my distribution (Sept
#07) and I didn't notice for ages.
#
#momo here is a Unix box running u9fs -a none and I'm using a
#terminal to play on so termrc it is
#
#cat /cfg/$sysname/termrc
#
#! fn start_httpd {
#! 	rfork
#! 	bind /n/momo/home/plan9/httpd /usr
#! 	bind /usr/httpd.rewrite /sys/lib/httpd.rewrite
#! 	ip/httpd/httpd -n /cfg/$sysname/namespace.httpd
#! }
#! 
#! 9fs momo
#! 
#! start_httpd &
#
#The folder /n/momo/home/plan9/httpd has in it :
#
#! bin/
#! web/
#! httpd.rewrite
#
#cat /cfg/$sysname/namespace.httpd
#
#! mount /srv/momo /n/momo
#! bind /n/momo/home/plan9/httpd/bin /bin/ip/httpd
#
#So now my /magic/ files are kept on momo so I don't pollute
#/bin/ip/httpd
#
#I also found a bug with vhosts and submitted a patch(1)
#httpd-post-port because vhosts running on non-default port were
#impossible as the :port was being stripped when the vhosts were
#parsed but not when matching http requests. Leaving the :port on is
#the correct behaviour according to RFC 2616 14.23.
