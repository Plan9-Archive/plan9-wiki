The Plan 9 web server httpd(8) has some interesting features. It also
kept me scratching my head all day getting it going so I thought I'd
share a few things.

When the httpd runs it sets itself to user "none" and runs newns(2)
and then addns(2) using the namespace provided on the command line
(or /lib/namespace.httpd if you didn't give it a -n). This means that
whatever you supply for the namespace file has to exist in the new
namespace. ip/httpd/httpd -n /cfg/$sysname/namespace.httpd was my
solution.

While experimenting I had the problem of how to kill a process owned
by none, here's how to do it :

! p = `{ps | grep httpd}
! chmod 777 /proc/$p(2) ^/note && echo kill > /proc/$p(2) ^/note

I'm assuming only one program called httpd is running, of course.

For extra fun ip/httpd/mirror was missing from my distribution (Sept
07) and I didn't notice for ages.

momo here is a Unix box running u9fs -a none and I'm using a terminal
to play on so termrc it is

cat /cfg/$sysname/termrc

! fn start_httpd {
! 	rfork
! 	bind /n/momo/home/plan9/httpd /usr
! 	bind /usr/httpd.rewrite /sys/lib/httpd.rewrite
! 	ip/httpd/httpd -n /cfg/$sysname/namespace.httpd
! }
! 
! 9fs momo
! 
! start_httpd &

The folder /n/momo/home/plan9/httpd has in it :

! bin/
! web/
! httpd.rewrite

cat /cfg/$sysname/namespace.httpd

! mount /srv/momo /n/momo
! bind /n/momo/home/plan9/httpd/bin /bin/ip/httpd

So now my /magic/ files are kept on momo so I don't pollute
/bin/ip/httpd

I also found a bug with vhosts and submitted a patch(1)
httpd-post-port because vhosts running on non-default port were
impossible as the :port was being stripped when the vhosts were
parsed but not when matching http requests. Leaving the :port on is
the correct behaviour according to RFC 2616 14.23.
