#This page describes how to FTP files from a Plan 9 terminal to an an
#ipaq running WinCE. You can use FTP rather than ActiveSync to
#download the linux "osloader" to your ipaq. If you do not have a
#Windows machine to run ActiveSync, then these instructions are for
#you.
#
#Attribution: This is based on a similar process for linux outlined
#at [http://www.handhelds.org/minihowto/wince-link/index.html].
#
#You need the WinCE Internet Explorer, a serial cradle, and a Plan 9
#terminal with a serial device. The idea is to run an FTP server on
#the terminal, establish a PPP connection to the ipaq, and use
#WinCE's IE to download files.
#
#CUSTOMIZE PPP
#
#Customize ppp(8) to skip authentication when run as a server. This
#is necessary because it is not evident how to set a WinCE user and
#secret for CHAP. Here is a patch to the February 21, 2003 version of
#ppp.c that disables authentication when given an empty secret (with
#-s ''):
#
#! 	/sys/src/cmd/ip/ppp/ppp.c:16 a ppp.c:17
#! 	> static	int	skipchap = 0;
#! 	/sys/src/cmd/ip/ppp/ppp.c:253 c ppp.c:254
#! 	< 		if(server)
#! 	---
#! 	> 		if(server && !skipchap)
#! 	/sys/src/cmd/ip/ppp/ppp.c:2617 a ppp.c:2619,2622
#! 	> 		if (strlen(secret) == 0) {
#! 	> 			secret = nil;
#! 	> 			skipchap = 1;
#! 	> 		}
#
#ON THE TERMINAL
#
#Run an FTP server and your custom PPP server on the terminal. The
#following examples illustrate what you might send to an interactive
#rc(1).
#
# *	Choose an unused IP address for the bitsy. You also need your
#	terminal's IP address.
#
#! 	bitsyip=192.168.1.22
#! 	termip=`{ndb/query sys $sysname ip}
#
# *	Create a directory to hold configuration files and your FTP
#	server's root directory.
#
#! 	root=/usr/$user/tmp/bitsy
#! 	mkdir $root
#
# *	Create an FTP root directory and namespace(6) file.
#
#! 	mkdir $root/ftp
#! 	echo 'mount #s/boot' / > $root/namespace.ftp
#! 	echo 'bind '$root'/ftp /' >> $root/namespace.ftp
#
# *	Use listen1 (in listen(8)) and ftpd (in ipserv(8)) to run your
#	FTP server:
#
#! 	aux/listen1 -tv tcp!*!ftp /bin/ip/ftpd -An $root/namespace.ftp &
#
# *	Create a chat file for dealing with WinCE's pre-PPP text.
#
#! 	echo ''''' CLIENT' > $root/chat
#! 	echo 'CLIENTSERVER ''''' >> $root/chat
#
# *	Run your modified ppp(8) server; this example assumes the ipaq is
#	connected to /dev/eia0 and your custom binary is called "myppp".
#
#! 	myppp -p /dev/eia0 -b 115200 -f -s '' -S -uM $root/chat $termip $bitsyip
#
#You can test your FTP server in another window with "ftpfs
#$sysname". After logging in as none, you should see the contents of
#$root/ftp under /n/ftp.
#
#ON THE IPAQ
#
#Configure WinCE to talk to the terminal and establish a PPP
#connection. The following worked with WinCE 3.0.9348 (Build 9616).
#See [http://www.handhelds.org/minihowto/wince-link/index.html] for
#alternative instructions.
#
# *	In Start, Settings, Connections, PC, create a new connection
#	called 9 with PPP, the $bitsyip IP address, 115200 baud, eight data
#	bits, no parity, one stop bit, hardware flow control, and autosync
#	turned off.
#
# *	Run Start, Programs, Connections, 9.
#
#You can test the connection with "ip/ping $bitsyip" on your terminal.
#
#USING THE CONNECTION
#
#Put the files you want to download in $root/ftp on the terminal.
#Open IE on the bitsy, turn on the address bar, if necessary, and
#enter
#
#! 	ftp://$termip/
#
#where $termip is your terminal's IP address.
