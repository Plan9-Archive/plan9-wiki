<a href="index.html">Sat May 11 10:07:39 EDT 2013</a>, a
</div><hr />This
page
is
a
collection
of
project
ideas,
things
which
might
be
useful
or
otherwise
nice
to
have.
It
is
inspired
by
the
"Ideas
page"
required
by
Google
Summer
of
Code,
but
includes
things
which
might
not
be
suitable
for
<a href="../GSoC">GSoC</a>
for
one
reason
or
another,
either
because
they
aren't
sufficently
explored
yet,
or
are
not
summer-sized,
or
whatever
other
reason.
That
said,
there's
no
fundamental
reason
ideas
from
this
page
couldn't
be
turned
into
suitable
GSoC
projects.
<p class='para'>
In
editing
this
page,
avoid
having
one
idea
swamp
the
others.
If
the
description
or
references
for
any
given
idea
grows
to
more
than
one
or
two
short
paragraphs,
it
likely
deserves
its
own
page.
Create
one,
and
link
to
it
from
here,
providing
a
very
brief
summary.

Our
GSoC
ideas
pages
from
years
past
may
also
be
interesting
reading:

<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/3/draw"><i>draw</i>(3)</a>
proxy
(Anthony
Sorace)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
It
would
be
nice
to
have
a
user-mode
proxy
for
the
draw
device,
which
would
present
the
same
interface
to
applications
and
pass
the
messages
to
a
real
draw
device.
A
reasonable
implementation
would
not
be
a
straight
pass-through,
but
the
bookkeeping
for
valid
connections
shouldn't
be
too
difficult.
The
proxy
function
itself
likely
wouldn't
be
terribly
interesting,
but
would
be
a
great
foundation
for
doing
all
sorts
of
interesting
transformations,
including
mirroring
or
concatenating
multiple
draw
devices,
providing
a
replay
of
messages,
or
providing
re-attachable
sessions.

<ul>

<li>
Synergy-workalike
(Anthony
Sorace)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
<a href="http://synergy-foss.org">Synergy</a>
is
a
bit
of
software
for
Windows
and
Unix-like
systems
which
allows
a
keyboard
and
mouse
physically
connected
to
one
system
to
control
them
all.
With
the
Plan
9
keyboard
and
mouse
input
model,
this
should
be
a
relatively
simple
proxy
which
creates
virtualized
keyboard
and
mouse
files
on
controlled
systems
(including,
presumably,
the
host),
mounted
before
rio
(or
acme
or
whatnot)
is
started.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Plan
B's
kbdfs
and
mousefs
are
implementations
of
this
idea.
kbdfs
claims
it
needs
a
rewrite;
both
are
written
around
the
Plan
B
discovery
and
sharing
model
of
"boxes".
