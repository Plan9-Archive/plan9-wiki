This page is a collection of project ideas, things which might be
useful or otherwise nice to have. It is inspired by the "Ideas page"
required by Google Summer of Code, but includes things which might
not be suitable for [GSoC] for one reason or another, either because
they aren't sufficently explored yet, or are not summer-sized, or
whatever other reason. That said, there's no fundamental reason ideas
from this page couldn't be turned into suitable GSoC projects.

In editing this page, avoid having one idea swamp the others. If the
description or references for any given idea grows to more than one
or two short paragraphs, it likely deserves its own page. Create one,
and link to it from here, providing a very brief summary.

Our GSoC ideas pages from years past may also be interesting reading:
[GSoC-2013-ideas] [GSoC-2012-ideas] [GSoC-2011-ideas].

 *	draw(3) proxy (Anthony Sorace)

It would be nice to have a user-mode proxy for the draw device, which
would present the same interface to applications and pass the
messages to a real draw device. A reasonable implementation would not
be a straight pass-through, but the bookkeeping for valid connections
shouldn't be too difficult. The proxy function itself likely wouldn't
be terribly interesting, but would be a great foundation for doing
all sorts of interesting transformations, including mirroring or
concatenating multiple draw devices, providing a replay of messages,
or providing re-attachable sessions.

See also Inferno's drawmux(2) and dmview(1) and [devdrawserver |
https://github.com/mariusaeriksen/devdrawserver], a version of this
idea for plan9port.

 *	Synergy-workalike (Anthony Sorace)

[Synergy | http://synergy-foss.org] is a bit of software for Windows
and Unix-like systems which allows a keyboard and mouse physically
connected to one system to control them all. With the Plan 9 keyboard
and mouse input model, this should be a relatively simple proxy which
creates virtualized keyboard and mouse files on controlled systems
(including, presumably, the host), mounted before rio (or acme or
whatnot) is started.

Plan B's kbdfs and mousefs are implementations of this idea. kbdfs
claims it needs a rewrite; both are written around the Plan B
discovery and sharing model of "boxes".
