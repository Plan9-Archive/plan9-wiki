#This page is a collection of project ideas, things which might be
#useful or otherwise nice to have. It is inspired by the "Ideas page"
#required by Google Summer of Code, but includes things which might
#not be suitable for [GSoC] for one reason or another, either because
#they aren't sufficently explored yet, or are not summer-sized, or
#whatever other reason. That said, there's no fundamental reason
#ideas from this page couldn't be turned into suitable GSoC projects.
#
#In editing this page, avoid having one idea swamp the others. If the
#description or references for any given idea grows to more than one
#or two short paragraphs, it likely deserves its own page. Create
#one, and link to it from here, providing a very brief summary.
#
#Our GSoC ideas pages from years past may also be interesting
#reading: [GSoC-2013-ideas] [GSoC-2012-ideas] [GSoC-2011-ideas].

# *	draw(3) proxy (Anthony Sorace)
#
#It would be nice to have a user-mode proxy for the draw device,
#which would present the same interface to applications and pass the
#messages to a real draw device. A reasonable implementation would
#not be a straight pass-through, but the bookkeeping for valid
#connections shouldn't be too difficult. The proxy function itself
#likely wouldn't be terribly interesting, but would be a great
#foundation for doing all sorts of interesting transformations,
#including mirroring or concatenating multiple draw devices,
#providing a replay of messages, or providing re-attachable sessions.
#
#See also Inferno's drawmux(2) and dmview(1) and [devdrawserver |
#https://github.com/mariusaeriksen/devdrawserver], a version of this
#idea for plan9port.

# *	Synergy-workalike (Anthony Sorace)
#
#[Synergy | http://synergy-foss.org] is a bit of software for Windows
#and Unix-like systems which allows a keyboard and mouse physically
#connected to one system to control them all. With the Plan 9
#keyboard and mouse input model, this should be a relatively simple
#proxy which creates virtualized keyboard and mouse files on
#controlled systems (including, presumably, the host), mounted before
#rio (or acme or whatnot) is started.
#
#Plan B's kbdfs and mousefs are implementations of this idea. kbdfs
#claims it needs a rewrite; both are written around the Plan B
#discovery and sharing model of "boxes".
