</div><hr />Plan9
has
several
options
for
web
browsers,
though
none
supports
perfectly
the
most
complex(or
broken)
websites
some
of
them
are
quite
useable.
<a name="ABACO" /><h3>ABACO</h3>

<p class='para'>
As
of
July
2009
the
lightweight
web
browser
abaco
is
now
distributed
as
part
of
the
stock
Plan
9
distribution.
It
is
a
web
browser
that
started
as
a
rewrite
of
webpage,
with
many
new
improvements
including
tables
support.
A
testing
snapshot
can
be
found
at:
/n/sources/contrib/fgb
</p>

<a name="CHARON" /><h3>CHARON</h3>

<p class='para'>
Charon
is
the
web
browser
supplied
with
the
Inferno
OS.
It
supports
Javascript
and
https.
It
has
very
few
features
(a
good
thing)
but
requires
the
inferno
runtime
environment.
Charon
is
packaged
as
part
of
<a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/downloads.html">Inferno</a>
</p>

<a name="WEBPAGE" /><h3>WEBPAGE</h3>

<p class='para'>
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/webfs"><i>webfs</i>(4)</a>
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/2/html"><i>html</i>(2)</a>
were
written
at
Bell
labs
as
the
backend
for
a
new
web
browser;
unfortunately
the
project
stalled.
Aki
Nyrhinen
has
since
written
a
simple
frontend
called
webpage
for
these
which
does
an
amazingly
good
job
of
rendering
basic
web
pages;
it
also
makes
interesting
use
of
the
plumber
to
support
hyperlinks.
This
work
also
stalled
and
has
been
superseded
by
abaco.
</p>

<a name="LINKS" /><h3>LINKS</h3>

<p class='para'>
Links
is
a
graphical
web
browser
which
renders
pages
fairly
well.
It
is
not
quite
stable,
crashing
on
some
pages
but
usable
for
google
searches
and
the
like.
It
supports
CSS
and
javascript
but
not
java
or
https
(though
this
would
not
take
a
great
deal
to
fix).
The
current
implementation
is
fairly
graphics
hungry
and
should
be
run
on
a
local
terminal
for
best
peformance.
The
greatest
annoyance
with
links
is
the
lack
of
support
for
cut
and
paste
between
links
windows
and
the
plan9
snarf
buffer.
The
source
is
availabe
in
Andrey
Mirtchov's
<a href="../contrib">contrib</a>
dir:
/n/sources/contrib/andrey/links.tgz
</p>

<a name="MOTHRA" /><h3>MOTHRA</h3>

<p class='para'>
Mothra
was
written
by
Tom
Duff
for
the
second
edition
of
plan9.
It
is
very
basic
and
does
not
support
ftp,
java,
javascript,
https
or
CSS.
On
the
other
hand
it
is
very
fast
and
compiles
natively
for
plan9.
The
sources
relies
on
the
second
edition
panel
library
which
has
also
been
released,
see
/n/sources/extra/mothra.

<a name="HGET_|_HTMLFMT" /><h3>HGET | HTMLFMT</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
plan9
tools
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/hget"><i>hget</i>(1)</a>
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/htmlfmt"><i>htmlfmt</i>(1)</a>
can
be
used
to
fetch
and
render
simple
web
pages
but
are
most
useful
for
scripted
fetches
(e.g.
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/ap"><i>ap</i>(1)</a>)
</p>

<a name="VNC_TO_WINDOWS_OR_*NIX" /><h3>VNC TO WINDOWS OR *NIX</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
best
way
to
get
a
fully
supported
web
browser
under
plan9
is
to
use
the
vnc
client
to
connect
to
a
linux
or
Windows
box.
This
performs
very
well
if
used
over
a
fast
network
connection.
