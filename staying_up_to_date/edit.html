Once you have Plan 9 installed, you'll probably want to keep your
installation up to date with respect to the changes that come out of
the labs. Assuming you have decent network access, the easiest way to
do this is to use replica/pull.

The instructions on this page assume you are updating a server or
standalone machine with x86 architecture. For a standalone ARM
computer such as the Raspberry Pi, read this page for background and
then see [Updating an ARM system].

UPDATING

To update your system, a script named 'pull' is available and is
located in the directory '/usr/glenda/bin/rc' (user glenda's home
directory). Note that this script assumes you are using the kfs(4)
file system, which nowadays is not likely to be the case. If your
system uses fossil(4), see the next paragraph below.

To execute the 'pull' script, just type:

! pull

Your system will be updated and you should see the files which are
updated scrolling down your window. If you do not have the pull
script installed, see the instructions below for your filesystem type.

For more information, see replica(1).

When the update is finished, old versions of binary files in /bin and
/bin/*/ will have been renamed by prefixing with an underscore
character. These can safely be deleted.

Pull uses the file server sources.cs.bell-labs.com. You can poke
around by running:

! 9fs sources
! cd /n/sources
! lc

FOSSIL

To update your fossil file system, you can usually just run the
following command:

! replica/pull -v /dist/replica/network

The -v option puts pull in verbose mode, allowing you to see the
current activity it is performing. This is useful if you're
interested in seeing what's being updated, but can produce lots of
output, so it's best to run it in a scrolling window or omit the -v.

Note that replica/pull takes care not to overwrite local changes, and
flags conflicts with error messages so that you can resolve them by
hand.

If you have done local modifications, pull will not overwrite the
changed file if an update occurs on sources. Use
! pull -s path/to/file
(where 'path/to/file' is the absolute path without the leading /) to
get the server-version of the specified file, or subtree if 'file' is
a directory, where in contrast -c keeps the client-version. Be aware
of running 'pull -s/' which specifies the server-version of all
files, as local configuration files may be updated undesirably. You
can do a "dry run" using the -n option, which will print the list of
files which would be updated but not perform the actual update.

OTHER ACCESS

You can also get access to the bleeding-edge sources and extra
software by typing:
! 9fs sources
! ls /n/sources

In case you don't have a Plan 9 network connection, you can always
download the nightly CD image from the download page and use it to
update.

! mount /srv/9660 /n/dist /tmp/plan9.iso

If you burned a CD with the unpacked image, the steps are

! 9660srv
! mount  /srv/9660 /n/dist /dev/sdD0/data
! replica/pull -v /dist/replica/cd

assuming you have the CDROM drive as the master on the second IDE
controller.
