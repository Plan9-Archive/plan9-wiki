Setting up Venti</h1>

<div class='body'> <!-- ***************************** -->

You'll
want
to
run
Venti
from
raw
disk
partitions
rather
than
files
on
a
file
system.
<p class='para'>
If
you
want
to
mirror
your
partitions
using
several
disks,
read
the
last
section
of
<a href="../setting_up_fossil">setting
up
fossil</a>
to
see
an
example
of
how
to
use
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/3/fs"><i>fs</i>(3)</a>
to
do
that.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Venti
storage
is
divided
into
a
log
holding
the
data
and
an
index
mapping
SHA1
hash
to
position
in
the
log.
The
log
is
split
into
fixed-size
(say,
500MB)
chunks
called
arenas.
There
may
be
more
than
one
file
holding
arenas
for
the
Venti
server.
Their
concatenation
forms
the
actual
log.
The
index
is
made
up
of
individual
index
section
files.
You
want
about
5%
as
much
index
space
as
you
have
arena
space.
So
if
you
have
100GB
of
arenas,
plan
on
5GB
of
index.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Use
disk/fdisk
to
create
a
Plan
9
partition
on
the
disks
you
wish
to
use
for
Venti.
Then
use
disk/prep
to
subdivide
the
Plan
9
partition
into
the
arena
files
or
index
sections
that
Venti
will
use.
The
rest
of
this
document
assumes
that
you
named
the
arena
files
/dev/sdC0/arenas{0,1}
and
that
you
named
the
index
sections
/dev/sdC0/isect{0,1}.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Format
the
arenas
with:
</p>

<pre>
venti/fmtarenas arenas0 /dev/sdC0/arenas0
venti/fmtarenas arenas1 /dev/sdC0/arenas1
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Format
the
index
sections
with:
</p>

<pre>
venti/fmtisect isect0 /dev/sdC0/isect0
venti/fmtisect isect1 /dev/sdC0/isect1
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
formatting
the
arenas
and
the
index
sections
zeros
the
disk
partitions,
so
it
takes
a
long
time.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Create
a
venti.conf
file
containing:
</p>

<pre>
# the name of the index
index main

# the index sections
isect /dev/sdC0/isect0
isect /dev/sdC0/isect1

# the arenas
arenas /dev/sdC0/arenas0
arenas /dev/sdC0/arenas1
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Format
the
index
itself
with:
</p>

<pre>
venti/fmtindex venti.conf
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
once
you
format
the
index
you
should
not
change
the
order
of
the
index
sections
nor
should
you
change
the
order
of
the
arenas.
It
is
safe
to
add
new
arenas.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
plan
on
booting
the
machine
with
venti/fossil
as
your
root
you
should
write
the
venti
config
into
the
arenas0
file:
</p>

<pre>
venti/conf -w /dev/sdC0/arenas0 &lt; venti.conf
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Now
the
disks
are
ready.
You
can
start
the
Venti
server
with
</p>

<pre>
venti/venti -w
</pre>

<p class='para'>
The
file
venti.conf
must
be
in
the
current
directory.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Set
the
environment
variable:
venti=your-ip-address
</p>

<p class='para'>
if
required,
you
can
put
this
in
the
startup
scripts
like
/rc/bin/termrc.
You
can
also
add
this
line
in
plan9.ini
</p>

<p class='para'>
Test
the
server
with:
</p>

<pre>
vac -f /tmp/x.vac /adm
vacfs /tmp/x.vac
ls -l /n/vac
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Congratulations!
You
have
a
Venti.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
plan
on
booting
with
venti/fossil
as
your
root
you
should
add
venti=/dev/sdC0/arenas0
in
your
plan9.ini.
During
boot
the
configuration
file
previously
written
to
the
start
of
this
partition
with
the
venti/conf
program
will
be
read
back
and
used.
</p>

<p class='para'>
See
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/6/venti.conf"><i>venti.conf</i>(6)</a>,
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/venti"><i>venti</i>(8)</a>,

<a name="PERFORMANCE" /><h3>PERFORMANCE</h3>

<p class='para'>
If
you're
worried
about
performance,
start
the
subpartitions
at
sector
offsets
that
are
multiples
of
16
so
that
8k
reads
will
be
8k-aligned
on
the
disk.
Or
use
type
other
in
disk/fdisk
for
the
partitions,
but
then
you
don't
get
such
good
partition
names.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Venti's
performance
is
tied
to
the
number
of
index
sections.
If
you're
going
for
high
performance,
get
a
handful
of
small
disks
to
use
for
the
index,
so
that
many
reads
can
happen
in
parallel.
</p>

<a name="SECURITY" /><h3>SECURITY</h3>

<p class='para'>
By
default
Venti
accepts
connections
from
anyone,
anywhere.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
are
running
in
a
hostile
environment
and
don't
want
just
anyone
connecting
to
your
Venti
server,
you
can
run
it
on
the
loopback
device.
Add
loopbackmedium
to
your
kernel
(it's
already
in
the
pccpu
and
pcauth
kernels)
and
then
run
</p>

<pre>
ip/ipconfig loopback /dev/null 127.1
</pre>

<p class='para'>
to
set
up
a
loopback
IP
address.
(Note
that
the
loopback
medium
is
not
compiled
into
the
PC
kernel
by
default).
Then
you
can
start
Venti
with
</p>

<pre>
venti/venti -a tcp!127.1!venti -h tcp!127.1!http -w
</pre>

<p class='para'>
and
it
will
only
take
connections
from
127.1.
</p>

<a name="TEMPORARY_FILES_AND_DIRECTORIES" /><h3>TEMPORARY FILES AND DIRECTORIES</h3>

<p class='para'>
For
some
purposes
it
is
desirable
to
exclude
files
or
directories
from
being
archived
to
venti.
For
example,
if
you
want
your
$home/tmp
excluded,
set
the
't'
flag
(temporary)
for
it
(see
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/chmod"><i>chmod</i>(1)</a>
for
details):
</p>

<pre>
chmod +t $home/tmp
</pre>

<p class='para'>
After
that,
no
files
in
tmp
will
be
archived
to
venti.
You
can
set
the
't'
flag
for
files,
too
</p>

<a name="LIVING_WITH_VENTI:_VAC_SCORES_AND_FLFMT" /><h3>LIVING WITH VENTI: VAC SCORES AND FLFMT</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
vac
score
given
on
the
fossil
console
after
an
archival
snapshot
differs
from
the
scores
given
by
the
vac
command
(on
the
console).
Only
the
former
contains
/active,
/snapshot
and
/archive.
And
only
the
former
can
therefore
be
used
to
do
a
flfmt
-v
&lt;score&gt;
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
vac
command
won't
show
up
these
root
scores.
But
Russ
Cox
posted
scripts
to
the
9fans
mailinglist.
One
of
them
gets
the
most
recent
root
score
of
a
particular
fossil
and
the
other
one
prints
the
scores
subsequent
to
it.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You
can
find
the
scripts
(and
his
explanation)
on
<a href="http://lists.cse.psu.edu/archives/9fans/2003-March/023470.html">http://lists.cse.psu.edu/archives/9fans/2003-March/023470.html</a>
