You'll want to run Venti from raw disk partitions rather than files
on a file system.

If you want to mirror your partitions using several disks, read the
last section of [setting up fossil] to see an example of how to use
fs(3) to do that.

Venti storage is divided into a log holding the data and an index
mapping SHA1 hash to position in the log. The log is split into
fixed-size (say, 500MB) chunks called arenas. There may be more than
one file holding arenas for the Venti server. Their concatenation
forms the actual log. The index is made up of individual index
section files. You want about 5% as much index space as you have
arena space. So if you have 100GB of arenas, plan on 5GB of index.

Use disk/fdisk to create a Plan 9 partition on the disks you wish to
use for Venti. Then use disk/prep to subdivide the Plan 9 partition
into the arena files or index sections that Venti will use. The rest
of this document assumes that you named the arena files
/dev/sdC0/arenas{0,1} and that you named the index sections
/dev/sdC0/isect{0,1}.

Format the arenas with:

! venti/fmtarenas arenas0 /dev/sdC0/arenas0
! venti/fmtarenas arenas1 /dev/sdC0/arenas1

Format the index sections with:

! venti/fmtisect isect0 /dev/sdC0/isect0
! venti/fmtisect isect1 /dev/sdC0/isect1

Note that formatting the arenas and the index sections zeros the disk
partitions, so it takes a long time.

Create a venti.conf file containing:

! # the name of the index
! index main
! 
! # the index sections
! isect /dev/sdC0/isect0
! isect /dev/sdC0/isect1
! 
! # the arenas
! arenas /dev/sdC0/arenas0
! arenas /dev/sdC0/arenas1

Format the index itself with:

! venti/fmtindex venti.conf

Note that once you format the index you should not change the order
of the index sections nor should you change the order of the arenas.
It is safe to add new arenas.

If you plan on booting the machine with venti/fossil as your root you
should write the venti config into the arenas0 file:

! venti/conf -w /dev/sdC0/arenas0 < venti.conf

Now the disks are ready. You can start the Venti server with

! venti/venti -w

The file venti.conf must be in the current directory.

Set the environment variable: venti=your-ip-address

if required, you can put this in the startup scripts like
/rc/bin/termrc. You can also add this line in plan9.ini

Test the server with:

! vac -f /tmp/x.vac /adm
! vacfs /tmp/x.vac
! ls -l /n/vac

Congratulations! You have a Venti.

If you plan on booting with venti/fossil as your root you should add
venti=/dev/sdC0/arenas0 in your plan9.ini. During boot the
configuration file previously written to the start of this partition
with the venti/conf program will be read back and used.

See venti.conf(6), venti(8), and ventiaux(8) for more information.

PERFORMANCE

If you're worried about performance, start the subpartitions at
sector offsets that are multiples of 16 so that 8k reads will be
8k-aligned on the disk. Or use type other in disk/fdisk for the
partitions, but then you don't get such good partition names.

Venti's performance is tied to the number of index sections. If
you're going for high performance, get a handful of small disks to
use for the index, so that many reads can happen in parallel.

SECURITY

By default Venti accepts connections from anyone, anywhere.

If you are running in a hostile environment and don't want just
anyone connecting to your Venti server, you can run it on the
loopback device. Add loopbackmedium to your kernel (it's already in
the pccpu and pcauth kernels) and then run

! ip/ipconfig loopback /dev/null 127.1

to set up a loopback IP address. (Note that the loopback medium is
not compiled into the PC kernel by default). Then you can start Venti
with

! venti/venti -a tcp!127.1!venti -h tcp!127.1!http -w

and it will only take connections from 127.1.

TEMPORARY FILES AND DIRECTORIES

For some purposes it is desirable to exclude files or directories
from being archived to venti. For example, if you want your $home/tmp
excluded, set the 't' flag (temporary) for it (see chmod(1) for
details):

! chmod +t $home/tmp

After that, no files in tmp will be archived to venti. You can set
the 't' flag for files, too

LIVING WITH VENTI: VAC SCORES AND FLFMT

The vac score given on the fossil console after an archival snapshot
differs from the scores given by the vac command (on the console).
Only the former contains /active, /snapshot and /archive. And only
the former can therefore be used to do a flfmt -v <score>

The vac command won't show up these root scores. But Russ Cox posted
scripts to the 9fans mailinglist. One of them gets the most recent
root score of a particular fossil and the other one prints the scores
subsequent to it.

You can find the scripts (and his explanation) on
