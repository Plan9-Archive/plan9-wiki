#GOAL
#
#Basic idea is to create a series of short (~10 minutes) well-edited
#tutorial introductions to Plan 9 as well as short talks on
#underlying philosophy and design principles. The idea is to follow
#the example of the (better) Google Code YouTube videos and provide a
#path for folks to learn a bit more about Plan 9. The idea is to mix
#lecture, screen videos, and discussion to hopefully encourage more
#of an interactive experience.
