Drawterm to your terminal

#This memo describes how to setup your standalone terminal to accept
#[drawterm] and cpu(1) connections.
#
#INSTANT CPU SERVER FROM LIVE CD
#
#This assumes DHCP internet service. Change the ip/ipconfig line if
#needed.
#
#! term% ip/ipconfig
#! term% auth/factotum
#! term% echo 'key proto=p9sk1 dom=livecd user=glenda !password=password' >/mnt/factotum/ctl
#! term% aux/listen1 -t tcp!*!17010 /bin/cpu -R &
#
#This shortcut works on any Plan 9 system that isn't already running
#a standard authserver + keyfs. It works because starting listen1
#with the -t flag keeps the factotum available in the namespace of
#the cpu listener for direct authentication. Drawterm from another OS
#will connect as usual. CPU from Plan 9 requires an auth server to
#validate the key.
#
#(There seems to be a "direct auth" trick drawterm does that CPU(1)
#does not. It would be nice if CPU(1) also could connect without an
#authserver with this setup.)
#
#SETTING UP WITH KEYFS AND AUTHSRV
#
#Keyfs(4) is the process managing the users' key database. Create a
#new key database as $home/lib/keys.
#! term% touch  $home/lib/keys
#
#Start keyfs(4). It will ask you the password which is used to
#encrypt the key database file ($home/lib/keys).
#! term% auth/keyfs  -p  $home/lib/keys
#! Password: keyfilepassword
#! 0 keys read
#! term%
#
#Add a user to the key database
#! term% auth/changeuser  -p  glenda
#! Password: loginpassword
#! Confirm password: loginpassword
#! assign Inferno/POP secret? (y/n) n
#! Expiration date (YYYYMMDD or never)[return = never]:
#! 1 keys read
#! Post id:
#! User's full name:
#! Department #:
#! User's email address:
#! Sponsor's email address:
#! changeuser: can't open /adm/keys.who
#
#The last line is just a warning. You can ignore it.
#
#Now populate the factotum(4) with the hostowner information.
#! term% echo 'key user=glenda dom=drawterm.test proto=p9sk1 !password=loginpassword' > /mnt/factotum/ctl
#
#Start the authentication server on the "ticket" port.
#! term% aux/listen1 -t 'tcp!*!ticket' /bin/auth/authsrv &
#
#Start the cpu service listener on the "ncpu" port.
#! term% service=cpu aux/listen1 'tcp!*!ncpu' /bin/cpu -R &
#
#Then connect to your terminal using drawterm.
#! $ drawterm  -a  ip.of.the.term  -c  ip.of.the.term
#
#Once you've finished the above sequence, the key database should be
#created correctly. So if you reboot your terminal, you don't need to
#repeat the whole thing again. In short, it should be enough to do
#the following:
#! term% auth/keyfs -p $home/lib/keys # you can add this command to your profile
#! Password: keyfilepassword
#! 1 keys read
#! term% echo 'key user=glenda dom=drawterm.test proto=p9sk1 !password=loginpassword' > /mnt/factotum/ctl
#! term% aux/listen1 -t 'tcp!*!ticket' /bin/auth/authsrv &
#! term% service=cpu aux/listen1 'tcp!*!ncpu' /bin/cpu -R &
#
#ANCIENT DRAWTERM VERSIONS
#
#If you need access from really old versions of drawterm that don't
#support 9p2000 change the aux/listen1 call to listen on port "cpu"
#and call cpu with the -O arg. Note that '-O' refers to the capital
#letter O and not a zero.
#
#! term% service=cpu aux/listen1 'tcp!*!cpu' /bin/cpu -O &
