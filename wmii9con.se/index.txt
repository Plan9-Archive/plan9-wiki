By subway go to Tekniska hogskolan and take the Roslagsbanan towards
Nasbypark to the Altorp station, it's the closest building to the
Altorp station.

Network connectivity and a already running Plan 9 network will be
available, but bringing at least a laptop is recommended. There are
sleeping places for five or six people, but they will need to bring
sleeping bags.
