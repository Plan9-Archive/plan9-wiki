Configuring file-backed Venti stores <i>-Diff-</i></h1>

</div><hr />Since
I
needed
this,
I
figured
it
might
be
useful
for
others.
Venti
can
be
used
with
files
on
your
Fossil
as
backing
storage.
There
is
no
steadfast
need
to
create
partitions
for
Venti
to
run
(and
in
some
cases,
this
configuration
may
even
be
more
convenient,
for
example
when
you're
on
a
laptop
with
frequently
added
and
erased
data).
I
was
bitten
by
a
couple
of
problems
that
I
figured
out
after
reading
the
manpages
several
times,
so
I'll
list
them
here
so
that
you
don't
have
to.
<p class='para'>
My
first
step
was
to
create
the
index
file.
I
have
no
idea
how
large
this
needs
to
be,
mathematically,
compared
to
the
size
of
the
Venti
arena.
I
suppose
it
would
be
something
like:
</p>

<p class='para'>
(arena_size
/
arena_block_size)
/
x
</p>

<p class='para'>
Where
x
is
however
large
a
Venti
index
datastructure
is.
I
could
find
this
if
I
read
the
paper
or
source,
but
I'm
too
lazy
right
now.
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
create
these
files,
I
simply
ran:
</p>

<pre>
	% dd -if /dev/zero -of isect0 -bs 8192 -count 10000
	% dd -if /dev/zero -of arenas0 -bs 8192 -count 40000
</pre>

<p class='para'>
When
these
completed,
the
following
files
were
present:
</p>

<pre>
	--rw-rw-r-- M 8 dho dho 327680000 Apr  3 20:10 arenas0
	--rw-rw-r-- M 8 dho dho  81920000 Apr  3 20:10 isect0
</pre>

<p class='para'>
After
this,
I
simply
created
a
venti.conf
file
that
was
the
same
as
the
one
in
the
manpage:
</p>

<pre>
	% cat &gt; venti.conf
	index main
	isect /usr/dho/isect0
	arenas /usr/dho/arenas0
	
	%
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Then
I
had
the
task
of
formatting
these
files.
First
I
ran:
</p>

<pre>
	% venti/fmtisect isect0 isect0
</pre>

<p class='para'>
This
took
a
little
while.
In
retrospect,
I
could
have
used
-Z,
since
I
created
this
file
with
/dev/zero.
The
-Z
flag
tells
fmtisect
and
fmtarenas
to
not
zero
the
``partition''
first,
which
is
superfluous
since
we
created
the
files
from
zero.
</p>

<p class='para'>
After
this,
I
ran:
</p>

<pre>
	% venti/fmtarenas arenas0 arenas0
</pre>

<p class='para'>
I
should
have
used
-Z
here
as
well.
Hereafter,
</p>

<pre>
	% venti/fmtindex venti.conf
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Yay,
all's
well,
right?
</p>

<pre>
	% venti/venti -c /usr/dho/venti.conf
	% venti=127.0.0.1
	% vac -f test.vac testfile
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Instead
of
getting
anything
useful,
I
got
some
error
about
how
I
had
no
space
in
my
arena.
This
didn't
make
much
sense
until
I
read
the
fmtarenas
section
of
the
manpage
a
few
more
times:
Venti
creates
its
arenas
with
a
default
size
of
500MB.
Mine's
smaller,
and
since
it
didn't
fulfill
the
size
requirement,
I
didn't
get
_any_
Venti
storage.
Lame.
</p>

<p class='para'>
So,
I
went
back
through
and
ran:
</p>

<pre>
	% venti/fmtisect isect0 isect0
	% venti/fmtarenas -a 327680000 arenas0 arenas0
	% venti/fmtindex venti.conf
</pre>

<p class='para'>
I
didn't
use
-Z
here,
since
the
fmtindex
actually
writes
to
the
index
file.
(And
I
wasn't
sure
if
it
wrote
to
the
arenas
file
too).
The
-a
flag
specifies
a
size
other
than
512MB
to
use
for
the
arena.
Apparently
this
value
should
always
be
set
to
the
size
of
the
arena
file
or
partition.
(Fancy
that!)
</p>

<p class='para'>
After
this:
</p>

<pre>
	% vac -f test.vac test
	packet: 1/9 frag: 1/6 small mem: 1/1 big mem: 1/8
	% ls -l
	d-rwxrwxr-x M 8 dho dho  0 Apr  3 19:15 test
	--rw-rw-r-- M 8 dho dho 45 Apr  3 20:10 test.vac
	% cat test.vac
	vac:d3d2b67810fb0fc289073c4b0c3ac6d9b01010fb
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Hope
that's
useful
to
someone.
</p>

<p class='para'>
--dho
</p>

<p class='para'>
Does
this
procedure
basically
work
on
Plan
9
Port
for
Unix-like
systems
as
well?
