Setting up Fossil <i>-Diff-</i></h1>

<div class='body'> <!-- ***************************** -->

<hr /><div class='diff_head'>
<a href="index.html">Mon May 18 17:51:54 EDT 2009</a>, a
</div><hr />Venti
is
necessary
to
get
the
most
out
of
Fossil.
See
<a href="../setting_up_Venti">setting
up
Venti</a>.
<p class='para'>
If
you
are
using
a
Venti
server
on
your
local
machine,
you
need
to
find
your
local
IP
address
(cat
/net/ndb)
and
set
</p>

<pre>
% venti=your-ip-address
</pre>

<p class='para'>
in
your
environment.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
main
data
storage
for
Fossil
is
the
Venti
server.
Fossil
keeps
dirty
blocks
and
ephemeral
snapshots
in
a
local
disk
partition
called
the
write
buffer.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
write
buffer
does
not
need
to
be
as
big
as
the
file
system
you
wish
to
store,
but
it
it
doesn't
hurt
and
it
makes
the
initialization
easier.
Rsc's
laptop
uses
a
fossil
write
buffer
of
a
gigabyte,
and
sources
server
uses
a
mere
half
gigabyte.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
if
you
built
a
fossil
(non-kfs)
machine
with
the
help
of
the
installer,
many
of
the
steps
in
this
document
have
already
been
done
by
the
installer.
It's
probably
worth
your
time
to
understand
what
it
did
on
your
behalf,
but
you
can
skip
over
doing
things
until
the
part
about
adding
"listen"
commands
to
serve
files
to
other
machines.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Format
the
write
buffer
with:
</p>

<pre>
% fossil/flfmt /dev/sdC0/fossil
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Then
create
a
file
called
flproto
containing:
</p>

<pre>
srv -p fscons
srv fossil
fsys main config /dev/sdC0/fossil
fsys main open -AWP
fsys main
</pre>

<p class='para'>
note:
make
sure
the
file
ends
in
'\n'
(i.e.
hit
enter
after
the
last
line)
--
otherwise,
fossil
will
silently
treat
it
as
an
error.
</p>

<p class='para'>
See
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/fossilcons"><i>fossilcons</i>(8)</a>
for
more
about
what
the
commands
mean.
Run
</p>

<pre>
% fossil/fossil -c '. flproto'
% con -l /srv/fscons
</pre>

<p class='para'>
to
start
fossil,
execute
the
flproto
script,
and
connect
to
the
console.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
any
command
in
the
script
fails,
the
script
does
not
continue.
Connecting
to
/srv/fscons
should
show
you
any
errors.
If
you
type
enter
a
few
times
you
should
get
</p>

<pre>
prompt:
main: 
main:
</pre>

<p class='para'>
(The
first
prompt
is
printed
before
the
script
runs.
The
last
command
in
the
script
changes
the
default
file
system
to
`main';
subsequent
prompts
reflect
this.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Draw
a
new
window
and
mount
fossil:
</p>

<pre>
% mount -c /srv/fossil /n/fossil
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Now
you
have
a
console
window
and
a
window
with
fossil
mounted.
You'll
be
switching
between
them
quite
a
bit.
The
examples
will
show
the
%
prompt
for
the
shell
commands
and
main:
for
the
fossil
console
commands.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
-AWP
flags
in
the
open
command
turn
off
authentication,
turn
on
arbitrary
wstats,
and
turn
off
permission
checking.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
fossil
file
system
has
three
main
trees:
/active,
/archive,
and
/snapshot.
The
active
file
system
is
in
/active.
When
you
mounted
/srv/fossil
before,
you
attached
to
/active.
See
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/fossil"><i>fossil</i>(4)</a>
for
more.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Before
you
can
create
files
with
particular
users
and
groups,
you
need
to
add
them
to
the
users
table.
Execute
the
following
at
the
fossil
console
to
create
a
users
file:
</p>

<pre>
main: create /active/adm adm sys d775
main: 
</pre>

<p class='para'>
You'll
probably
want
to
use
the
same
set
of
users
from
your
current
file
system.
The
file
format
has
changed
slightly
from
the
old
kfs
format,
in
that
the
first
field
is
now
a
string
rather
than
a
number.
(The
string
is
what
gets
stored
in
the
fossil
disk
structures,
just
like
a
number
gets
stored
in
the
kfs
and
fs
disk
structures.)
You
can
convert
by
running:
</p>

<pre>
% sed 's/^([^:]+):([^:]+)/\2:\2/' /adm/users &gt;/n/fossil/adm/users
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Here,
/adm/users
comes
probably
from
your
local
kfs.
Then
tell
fossil
to
reload
the
users
file:
</p>

<pre>
main: users -r /active/adm/users
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Test
that
the
reload
worked
by
running:
</p>

<pre>
% echo hi &gt;/n/fossil/foo
% chgrp glenda /n/fossil/foo
% ls -l /n/fossil/foo
% rm /n/fossil/foo
</pre>

<p class='para'>
The
chgrp
should
succeed.
If
it
doesn't,
the
users
table
isn't
right.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
you're
in
a
good
state
for
initializing
the
file
system,
which
you
can
do
with:
</p>

<pre>
% mount /srv/kfs /n/kfs
% disk/mkfs -a -s /n/kfs /sys/lib/sysconfig/proto/allproto | 
	disk/mkext -u -d /n/fossil
</pre>

<p class='para'>
If
your
kfs
and
fossil
write
buffer
are
on
the
same
disk,
you
may
find
that
running
one
and
then
the
other
is
much
faster
so
they
don't
contend
for
the
disk:
</p>

<pre>
% disk/mkfs -a -s /n/kfs /sys/lib/sysconfig/proto/allproto &gt;/somewhere/else
% disk/mkext -u -d /n/fossil &lt;/somewhere/else
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Now
you
have
a
file
system.
The
users
file
probably
just
got
overwritten,
so
put
it
back:
</p>

<pre>
main: users -w
</pre>

<p class='para'>
This
will
overwrite
/adm/users
with
the
current
in-memory
table.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Take
an
archival
snapshot:
</p>

<pre>
main: snap -a
</pre>

<p class='para'>
(Note:
even
though
a
prompt
is
printed
immediately
after
you
hit
enter,
the
command
takes
up
to
10
seconds
to
commence.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
After
a
short
pause,
the
disk
will
start
whirring
as
all
the
blocks
you
just
copied
get
sent
off
to
Venti.
Eventually
this
will
finish,
but
it
is
likely
to
take
a
long
time
depending
on
what
you
copied
to
your
active
system.
When
Fossil
finishes
archiving,
it
will
print
a
message
like:
</p>

<pre>
archive vac:080b64...
</pre>

<p class='para'>
to
the
console.
The
vac
hash
of
the
archive
can
be
given
to
fossil/flfmt
to
reset
the
fossil
partition
if
it
is
ever
lost,
or
to
vacfs
to
look
at
the
archive.
</p>

<p class='para'>
For
kicks,
kill
off
fossil
and
restart
it:
</p>

<pre>
% kill fossil | rc
% fossil/fossil -c '. flproto'
</pre>

<p class='para'>
In
your
console
window
you'll
have
to
connect
to
/srv/fscons
again.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Check
that
everything
is
there:
</p>

<pre>
% mount /srv/fossil /n/fossil
% mount /srv/fossil /n/archive main/archive
% ls -l /n/fossil
% ls -l /n/archive
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Neat,
huh?
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
we're
ready
to
start
things
for
real.
Add
the
line
</p>

<pre>
users -r /active/adm/users
</pre>

<p class='para'>
to
the
flproto
file
and
remove
the
-AWP
flags
from
open.
Restart
fossil:
</p>

<pre>
g% kill fossil | rc
g% fossil/fossil -c '. flproto'
g% mount /srv/fossil /n/fossil
g% mount /srv/fossil /n/archive main/archive
g% ls -l /n/archive
</pre>

<p class='para'>
If
you
want
to
serve
the
network
you
can
run
the
commands
</p>

<pre>
listen tcp!*!9fs
listen il!*!9fs
</pre>

<p class='para'>
in
flproto
or
at
the
console.
Now
others
can
connect.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
if
your
fossil
is
your
primary
file
system
and
is
being
launched
at
boot
time
by
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/boot"><i>boot</i>(8)</a>
you
should
use
the
numerical
forms
of
the
port
numbers
(tcp!*!564
and
il!*!17008)
instead
of
the
symbolic
names
because
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ndb"><i>ndb</i>(8)</a>
servers
won't
be
running
yet.
Also,
you
will
probably
want
to
brand
your
flproto
onto
your
fossil
partition
using
fossil/conf,
see
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/fossil"><i>fossil</i>(4)</a>.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Connections
(even
over
local
/srv
files)
are
authenticated
using
factotum.
If
you
are
booting
standalone
and
don't
use
p9sk1
keys,
you'll
have
to
add
a
key
to
your
factotum
to
use
for
the
authentication.
Specifically,
if
</p>

<pre>
% grep p9sk1 /mnt/factotum/ctl
</pre>

<p class='para'>
doesn't
find
anything,
then
you
should
run
</p>

<pre>
% echo 'key proto=p9sk1 user=you dom=local !password=local' &gt;/mnt/factotum/ctl
</pre>

<p class='para'>
to
set
up
a
key.
This
will
be
necessary
for
the
mount
to
work
once
you
lose
the
-AWP
flags.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
user
name
should
be
your
user
name
on
the
local
machine.
The
password
can
be
anything.
(Since
both
mount
and
fossil
are
using
the
same
factotum
and
thus
the
same
keys,
the
authentication
will
succeed!)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Congratulations!
You
have
a
fossil.

<a name="BOOTING_A_STANDALONE_FOSSIL_SYSTEM" /><h3>BOOTING A STANDALONE FOSSIL SYSTEM</h3>

<p class='para'>
NOTE:
this
section
relates
to
an
older
type
of
kernels,
called
'pcfl'
which
have
now
been
deprecated
for
the
'pcf'
ones,
which
allow
you
to
change
fossil
configurations
without
having
to
recompile
kernels.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
have
installed
Plan
9
directly
onto
a
disk
without
using
a
kfs
partition
then
you
do
not
need
to
read
this
section.
</p>

<p class='para'>
This
is
complicated
and
clunky.
You
will
have
to
debug
something
along
the
way.
You
really
need
to
understand
how
the
system
works
and
how
all
the
pieces
fit
together
before
you
attempt
this.
</p>

<p class='para'>
It
is
possible
to
build
a
kernel
that
boots
from
a
local
fossil
system.
The
pc
kernel
configuration
pcfl
is
the
starting
point.
Copy
pcfl
to
pcyour-sys-name
and
then:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
change
cpuserver
=
0
to
cpuserver
=
1
in
port
if
you
want
a
cpu
server.
</li>

<li>
change
fl
to
your
own
system
name
in
the
paths
in
the
bootdir
section.
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
You
need
to
create
/sys/lib/sysconfig/your-sys-name
and
populate
it.
The
files
in
/sys/lib/sysconfig/fl
are
a
good
starting
point.
You'll
want
to
edit
them
to
suit
your
setup.
In
particular,
you
need
to:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
change
boot's
cpuserver=no
to
cpuserver=yes
if
desired
</li>

<li>
change
boot's
venti
command
line
if
desired
</li>

<li>
change
flproto
to
fit
your
configuration;
note
that
the
srv
file
must
be
named
boot
and
not
fossil.
</li>

<li>
change
venti.conf
to
fit
your
configuration.
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
You
may
also
have
to
edit
the
set
of
boot
files
in
the
configuration
file
for
the
kernel
to
include
fdisk,
and
run
fdisk
-p
from
your
boot
script,
if
your
venti
partitions
need
so
to
be
learned.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
you
should
be
able
to
build
a
kernel
and
boot
it.
Note
that
you
have
to
run
lnfs
in
order
to
build.
</p>

<p class='para'>
It
probably
won't
boot
because
something
isn't
set
up
quite
right.
You're
on
your
own
for
debugging.
