<a name="INSTANT_9P_CONNECTION_BETWEEN_TWO_MACHINES" /><h3>INSTANT 9P CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO MACHINES</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
following
should
be
used
only
on
secure
private
networks
or
by
machines
with
no
private
data.
It
provides
a
read-only
public
9p
service
of
the
full
namespace
of
the
invoking
user:
</p>

<pre>
server% aux/listen1 -tv tcp!*!9999 /bin/exportfs -R -r /
</pre>

<p class='para'>
To
dial
and
mount
this
service
from
another
machine:
</p>

<pre>
client% srv tcp!ip.of.server!9999 server /n/server
</pre>

<p class='para'>
The
client
machine
will
print
"post..."
and
following
this,
the
client
may
</p>

<pre>
client% ls /n/server
</pre>

<p class='para'>
and
use
other
commands
to
work
with
the
mounted
filesystem.
After
this
connection
has
been
made,
you
may
terminate
the
listener
on
the
server
machine.
It
is
not
needed
once
the
mount
has
been
made.
</p>

<a name="STANDARD_9P_SERVICES_FROM_FILE_AND_CPU_SERVERS" /><h3>STANDARD 9P SERVICES FROM FILE AND CPU SERVERS</h3>

<p class='para'>
There
are
two
main
types
of
9p
service
provided
in
a
typical
installation.
Disk
fileservers
such
as
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/fossil"><i>fossil</i>(4)</a>
serve
9p
on
port
564.
This
is
used
for
tcp
boot
of
other
machines
or
general
purpose
disk
storage.
The
Bell
Labs
"sources"
server
is
an
example.
The
commands
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/srv"><i>srv</i>(4)</a>
and
the
9fs
script
connect
to
this
type
of
9p
server.
</p>

<p class='para'>
CPU
servers
serve
9p
via
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/exportfs"><i>exportfs</i>(4)</a>
on
port
17007
and
clients
connect
by
means
of
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/import"><i>import</i>(4)</a>.
Exportfs
enables
serving
arbitrary
namespace,
not
simply
on-disk
file
servers.
The
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/cpu"><i>cpu</i>(1)</a>
command
makes
use
of
exportfs
to
let
the
cpu
server
use
the
devices
and
filesystem
of
the
client
terminal.
Cpu
export/import
traffic
is
encrypted
by
default.
9p
file
service
on
port
564
is
not.
The
normal
usage
for
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/import"><i>import</i>(4)</a>
requires
specifying
what
portion
of
the
cpu
namespace
to
attach.
An
example:
</p>

<pre>
client% import cpuserver /srv /n/cpusrv
</pre>

<p class='para'>
This
selects
only
the
/srv
of
the
target
cpuserver
and
mounts
it
to
/n/cpusrv.
Some
of
the
most
important
targets
for
import
are
/srv
and
/proc.
A
grid
of
cpu
servers
running
from
a
common
file
server
and
which
all
import
/srv
and
/proc
and
certain
/dev
files
from
each
other
behaves
very
much
like
single
large
machine.
This
is
the
prototypical
form
of
a
"Plan
9
Grid"
of
machines.
</p>

<a name="SERVICES_ON_DEMAND:_USING_AUX/LISTEN1_AND_EXPORTFS" /><h3>SERVICES ON DEMAND: USING AUX/LISTEN1 AND EXPORTFS</h3>

<p class='para'>
In
a
standard
configuration
of
installed
machines,
file
servers
listen
on
port
564
and
cpus
listen
on
port
17007.
The
file
listener
is
the
responsibility
of
the
disk
fs,
but
the
cpu
listener
is
started
by
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/aux/listen"><i>aux/listen</i>(8)</a>
command
which
starts
listeners
for
every
service
found
in
/rc/bin/service.
The
aux/listen1
command
allows
users
to
start
individual
service
listeners
on
demand.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Using
this
effectively
requires
understanding
the
additional
options
for
exportfs.
There
is
an
important
caveat
-
the
-a
flag
for
authentication
of
exportfs
is
in
conflict
with
the
-r
and
-S
flags
for
specifying
a
root
or
/srv
to
mount.
If
you
wish
to
use
exportfs
to
provide
secure
non-root
service
exportfs
publicly,
additional
measures
such
as
the
use
of
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/tlssrv"><i>tlssrv</i>(8)</a>
would
be
necessary.
</p>

<p class='para'>
When
exportfs
is
used
with
the
flag
-r
to
specify
a
root
or
-S
to
specify
a
/srv,
it
becomes
compatible
with
the
operation
of
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/srv"><i>srv</i>(4)</a>
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/mount"><i>mount</i>(1)</a>.
An
exportfs
done
with
these
flags
may
be
used
via
srv
and
mount
of
the
address.
Srv
may
not
be
used
to
attach
to
standard
exportfs
listeners
running
the
full
protocol.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
example
at
the
beginning
of
this
page
shows
the
basic
formula
for
using
exportfs
and
srv
together
in
this
manner.
If
you
wish
to
use
exportfs
for
authenticated
connections,
use
import
for
the
client,
like
this:
</p>

<pre>
server% aux/listen1 -v tcp!*!9999 /bin/exportfs -a 
client% import tcp!server!9999 /remote/path /local/mountpoint
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Note
the
absence
of
the
-t
flag
from
this
listen1
command.
</p>

<a name="SRV_IN_DETAIL:_MORE_THAN_JUST_9P" /><h3>SRV IN DETAIL: MORE THAN JUST 9P</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/srv"><i>srv</i>(4)</a>
command
as
used
above
is
actually
two
commands
in
one.
An
initial
srv
to
dial
a
connection
and
post
a
file
descriptor
in
/srv,
and
a
mount
command
to
attach
to
that
file
descriptor
as
a
9p
fs.
If
you
use
srv
in
this
manner:
</p>

<pre>
server% srv tcp!server!port srvname
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Then
srv
acts
to
dial
server
and
post
that
network
connection
as
a
file
descriptor
in
/srv.
If
that
file
descriptor
is
a
9p
fs,
it
can
be
mounted.
If
it
is
not
a
9p
fs,
it
can
still
be
interacted
with.
An
example
to
show
the
principles:
</p>

<pre>
server% aux/listen1 -tv tcp!*!9999 /bin/cat /lib/namespace 
client% srv tcp!server!9999 remotens 
client% cat /srv/remotens
</pre>

<p class='para'>
The
output
will
be
the
output
of
the
cat
command
on
the
server
machine.
In
the
case
of
a
9p
service,
you
can
separate
the
srv
and
the
mount
as
follows:
</p>

<pre>
client% srv tcp!server!564 server
client% mount /srv/server /n/server
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
the
action
of
srv
simply
dials
and
places
a
file
descriptor.
If
authentication
is
required,
that
occurs
when
the
mount
command
is
issued.
</p>

<a name="LISTEN1_AND_NAMESPACES:_THE_-T_FLAG" /><h3>LISTEN1 AND NAMESPACES: THE -T FLAG</h3>

<p class='para'>
Most
of
the
examples
on
this
page
use
the
-t
flag
for
listen1.
This
means
that
the
service
listener
is
running
as
the
invoking
user.
Without
the
-t
flag,
the
listener
runs
as
user
"none".
This
is
a
significant
difference
because
your
user
account
has
a
different
namespace
than
the
"generic"
namespace
of
"none".
When
you
need
to
share
a
namespace
that
includes
mounts
and
binds
that
are
not
part
of
the
generic
namespace,
the
-t
flag
is
necessary.
</p>

<p class='para'>
However,
this
does
make
the
listener
more
vulnerable
to
malicious
security
threats.
As
user
"none"
a
listener
which
is
subverted
can
do
much
less
harm
than
a
user
listening
under
the
identity
of
the
invoking
user,
especially
if
that
user
is
the
hostowner.
Be
aware
of
the
difference
between
-t
and
listening
as
none.
It
is
usually
easier
and
more
convenient
to
listen
as
your
user
account,
but
this
is
not
recommended
for
public
facing
services
or
services
which
may
be
connected
to
by
untrusted
users.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Also
understand
that
some
processes,
such
as
the
server
side
of
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/cpu"><i>cpu</i>(1)</a>,
may
be
able
to
change
user
identity
even
when
the
invoking
listener
is
none.
</p>

<a name="OTHER_ISSUES" /><h3>OTHER ISSUES</h3>

<p class='para'>
This
page
does
not
address
the
configuration
of
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ndb"><i>ndb</i>(8)</a>
and
the
configuration
of
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/factotum"><i>factotum</i>(4)</a>
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/auth"><i>auth</i>(8)</a>.
It
is
crucial
to
have
a
correct
/lib/ndb/local
and
correct
authentication
between
grid
nodes
for
standard
use
of
these
tools
as
described
by
the
manpages
and
this
article.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Mounting
and
serving
9p
can
also
be
done
with
Inferno,
plan9port,
and
many
other
libraries
and
tools.
In
general
correctly
implemented
clients
and
servers
should
all
be
compatible,
but
in
practice
issues
like
support
for
the
exportfs
protocol
may
require
adjustments
and
compromises.
The
initial
author
of
this
wiki
page
recommends
u9fs,
9pfuse,
plan9port,
and
Inferno
as
the
best
supported
non-plan9
9p
clients
and
servers.
