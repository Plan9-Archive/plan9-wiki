INSTANT 9P CONNECTION BETWEEN TWO MACHINES

The following should be used only on secure private networks or by
machines with no private data. It provides a read-only public 9p
service of the full namespace of the invoking user:

! server% aux/listen1 -tv tcp!*!9999 /bin/exportfs -R -r /

To dial and mount this service from another machine:

! client% srv tcp!ip.of.server!9999 server /n/server

The client machine will print "post..." and following this, the
client may

! client% ls /n/server

and use other commands to work with the mounted filesystem. After
this connection has been made, you may terminate the listener on the
server machine. It is not needed once the mount has been made.

STANDARD 9P SERVICES FROM FILE AND CPU SERVERS

There are two main types of 9p service provided in a typical
installation. Disk fileservers such as fossil(4) serve 9p on port
564. This is used for tcp boot of other machines or general purpose
disk storage. The Bell Labs "sources" server is an example. The
commands srv(4) and the 9fs script connect to this type of 9p server.

CPU servers serve 9p via exportfs(4) on port 17007 and clients
connect by means of import(4). Exportfs enables serving arbitrary
namespace, not simply on-disk file servers. The cpu(1) command makes
use of exportfs to let the cpu server use the devices and filesystem
of the client terminal. Cpu export/import traffic is encrypted by
default. 9p file service on port 564 is not. The normal usage for
import(4) requires specifying what portion of the cpu namespace to
attach. An example:

! client% import cpuserver /srv /n/cpusrv

This selects only the /srv of the target cpuserver and mounts it to
/n/cpusrv. Some of the most important targets for import are /srv and
/proc. A grid of cpu servers running from a common file server and
which all import /srv and /proc and certain /dev files from each
other behaves very much like single large machine. This is the
prototypical form of a "Plan 9 Grid" of machines.

SERVICES ON DEMAND: USING AUX/LISTEN1 AND EXPORTFS

In a standard configuration of installed machines, file servers
listen on port 564 and cpus listen on port 17007. The file listener
is the responsibility of the disk fs, but the cpu listener is started
by the aux/listen(8) command which starts listeners for every service
found in /rc/bin/service. The aux/listen1 command allows users to
start individual service listeners on demand.

Using this effectively requires understanding the additional options
for exportfs. There is an important caveat - the -a flag for
authentication of exportfs is in conflict with the -r and -S flags
for specifying a root or /srv to mount. If you wish to use exportfs
to provide secure non-root service exportfs publicly, additional
measures such as the use of tlssrv(8) would be necessary.

When exportfs is used with the flag -r to specify a root or -S to
specify a /srv, it becomes compatible with the operation of srv(4)
and mount(1). An exportfs done with these flags may be used via srv
and mount of the address. Srv may not be used to attach to standard
exportfs listeners running the full protocol.

The example at the beginning of this page shows the basic formula for
using exportfs and srv together in this manner. If you wish to use
exportfs for authenticated connections, use import for the client,
like this:

! server% aux/listen1 -v tcp!*!9999 /bin/exportfs -a 
! client% import tcp!server!9999 /remote/path /local/mountpoint

Note the absence of the -t flag from this listen1 command.

SRV IN DETAIL: MORE THAN JUST 9P

The srv(4) command as used above is actually two commands in one. An
initial srv to dial a connection and post a file descriptor in /srv,
and a mount command to attach to that file descriptor as a 9p fs. If
you use srv in this manner:

! server% srv tcp!server!port srvname

Then srv acts to dial server and post that network connection as a
file descriptor in /srv. If that file descriptor is a 9p fs, it can
be mounted. If it is not a 9p fs, it can still be interacted with. An
example to show the principles:

! server% aux/listen1 -tv tcp!*!9999 /bin/cat /lib/namespace 
! client% srv tcp!server!9999 remotens 
! client% cat /srv/remotens

The output will be the output of the cat command on the server
machine. In the case of a 9p service, you can separate the srv and
the mount as follows:

! client% srv tcp!server!564 server
! client% mount /srv/server /n/server

Note that the action of srv simply dials and places a file
descriptor. If authentication is required, that occurs when the mount
command is issued.

LISTEN1 AND NAMESPACES: THE -T FLAG

Most of the examples on this page use the -t flag for listen1. This
means that the service listener is running as the invoking user.
Without the -t flag, the listener runs as user "none". This is a
significant difference because your user account has a different
namespace than the "generic" namespace of "none". When you need to
share a namespace that includes mounts and binds that are not part of
the generic namespace, the -t flag is necessary.

However, this does make the listener more vulnerable to malicious
security threats. As user "none" a listener which is subverted can do
much less harm than a user listening under the identity of the
invoking user, especially if that user is the hostowner. Be aware of
the difference between -t and listening as none. It is usually easier
and more convenient to listen as your user account, but this is not
recommended for public facing services or services which may be
connected to by untrusted users.

Also understand that some processes, such as the server side of
cpu(1), may be able to change user identity even when the invoking
listener is none.

OTHER ISSUES

This page does not address the configuration of ndb(8) and the
configuration of factotum(4) and auth(8). It is crucial to have a
correct /lib/ndb/local and correct authentication between grid nodes
for standard use of these tools as described by the manpages and this
article.

Mounting and serving 9p can also be done with Inferno, plan9port, and
many other libraries and tools. In general correctly implemented
clients and servers should all be compatible, but in practice issues
like support for the exportfs protocol may require adjustments and
compromises. The initial author of this wiki page recommends u9fs,
9pfuse, plan9port, and Inferno as the best supported non-plan9 9p
clients and servers.
