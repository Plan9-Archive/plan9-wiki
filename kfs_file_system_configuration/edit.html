USERS AND PERMISSIONS

There is no super-user; the closest equivalent is the person who
booted the terminal (generically called Eve; Adm owns the file
server). Most devices are owned by Eve, and the local kernel will let
Eve do most things commonly associated with a super-user (for
example, debug or kill processes she doesn't own). Eve's power does
not extend past the local machine, though, or even into the kfs file
system. The important difference is that the kfs file system is being
provided by a user process, which has its own permissions checking
separate from the kernel, and it does not care to let the hostowner
have special permissions directly.

Of course, permissions need to be bypassed once in a while. For
example, the file /adm/users (the equivalent of a combination of
Unix's /etc/passwd and /etc/group) is not writable except by members
of group adm. Rather than put yourself into the group adm, we usually
type 'disk/kfscmd allow' to turn off permission checking on the kfs
file server, edit /adm/users, make kfs read it back by typing
disk/kfscmd user, and then turn permission checking back on by typing
'disk/kfscmd disallow' (If you're running a network file server, the
preferred but rarer setup, all this hair-raising stuff is avoided;
appropriate control is provided on the file server console and
nowhere else.)

To add a new user, add the user to the /adm/users file and then run
the user command; the format of the file is documented in users(6).
(Note that on a standalone file server, the newuser command manages
users, to avoid turning off permission checking.) The fs(8) and
kfscmd(8) manual pages explain more file system commands.

To create a new user, you can run

! disk/kfscmd 'newuser tor'

it will automatically perform the following tasks

- add a line like

! 282:tor:tor:

to /adm/users

- run disk/kfscmd user - run the following commands

! disk/kfscmd 'create /usr/tor tor tor 775 d'

I think these two commands have to be executed manually

! disk/kfscmd 'create /mail/box/tor tor upas 775 d'
! disk/kfscmd 'create /mail/box/tor/mbox tor upas 622 al'

creating tor's home directory and mail box. Now you'll want to halt
the disks and reboot to log in as tor; the first thing to do then is
to set up a profile and start the window system by running

! /sys/lib/newuser

Note that you had to reboot to log in as a different user; this is
because the kernel must authenticate to the file server in order to
obtain startup files like init or its startup script, and the only
way for a terminal to get authentication credentials is to have a
user type a name and password. Of course, for kfs this could be
sidestepped, but this is necessary when booting from a real file
server on the network.

STARTUP

When a Plan 9 machine boots, it runs the configuration script
/rc/bin/termrc or /rc/bin/cpurc, depending on whether it is a
terminal or a CPU server. These set up /dev and initialize some
common environment variables, in particular $fileserver. This
variable is used by lp, among other programs. For a standalone
configuration, this should be kfs, as it is when installed; if you
set up a real Plan 9 file server and boot over the network, change
this to be the name of the network file server.
