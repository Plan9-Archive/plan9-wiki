<a name="USERS_AND_PERMISSIONS" /><h3>USERS AND PERMISSIONS</h3>

<p class='para'>
There
is
no
super-user;
the
closest
equivalent
is
the
person
who
booted
the
terminal
(generically
called
Eve;
Adm
owns
the
file
server).
Most
devices
are
owned
by
Eve,
and
the
local
kernel
will
let
Eve
do
most
things
commonly
associated
with
a
super-user
(for
example,
debug
or
kill
processes
she
doesn't
own).
Eve's
power
does
not
extend
past
the
local
machine,
though,
or
even
into
the
kfs
file
system.
The
important
difference
is
that
the
kfs
file
system
is
being
provided
by
a
user
process,
which
has
its
own
permissions
checking
separate
from
the
kernel,
and
it
does
not
care
to
let
the
hostowner
have
special
permissions
directly.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Of
course,
permissions
need
to
be
bypassed
once
in
a
while.
For
example,
the
file
/adm/users
(the
equivalent
of
a
combination
of
Unix's
/etc/passwd
and
/etc/group)
is
not
writable
except
by
members
of
group
adm.
Rather
than
put
yourself
into
the
group
adm,
we
usually
type
'disk/kfscmd
allow'
to
turn
off
permission
checking
on
the
kfs
file
server,
edit
/adm/users,
make
kfs
read
it
back
by
typing
disk/kfscmd
user,
and
then
turn
permission
checking
back
on
by
typing
'disk/kfscmd
disallow'
(If
you're
running
a
network
file
server,
the
preferred
but
rarer
setup,
all
this
hair-raising
stuff
is
avoided;
appropriate
control
is
provided
on
the
file
server
console
and
nowhere
else.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
add
a
new
user,
add
the
user
to
the
/adm/users
file
and
then
run
the
user
command;
the
format
of
the
file
is
documented
in
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/6/users"><i>users</i>(6)</a>.
(Note
that
on
a
standalone
file
server,
the
newuser
command
manages
users,
to
avoid
turning
off
permission
checking.)
The
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/fs"><i>fs</i>(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/kfscmd"><i>kfscmd</i>(8)</a>
manual
pages
explain
more
file
system
commands.
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
create
a
new
user,
you
can
run
</p>

<pre>
disk/kfscmd 'newuser tor'
</pre>

<p class='para'>
it
will
automatically
perform
the
following
tasks
</p>

<p class='para'>
-
add
a
line
like
</p>

<pre>
282:tor:tor:
</pre>

<p class='para'>
to
/adm/users
</p>

<p class='para'>
-
run
disk/kfscmd
user
-
run
the
following
commands
</p>

<pre>
disk/kfscmd 'create /usr/tor tor tor 775 d'
</pre>

<p class='para'>
I
think
these
two
commands
have
to
be
executed
manually
</p>

<pre>
disk/kfscmd 'create /mail/box/tor tor upas 775 d'
disk/kfscmd 'create /mail/box/tor/mbox tor upas 622 al'
</pre>

<p class='para'>
creating
tor's
home
directory
and
mail
box.
Now
you'll
want
to
halt
the
disks
and
reboot
to
log
in
as
tor;
the
first
thing
to
do
then
is
to
set
up
a
profile
and
start
the
window
system
by
running
</p>

<pre>
/sys/lib/newuser
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
you
had
to
reboot
to
log
in
as
a
different
user;
this
is
because
the
kernel
must
authenticate
to
the
file
server
in
order
to
obtain
startup
files
like
init
or
its
startup
script,
and
the
only
way
for
a
terminal
to
get
authentication
credentials
is
to
have
a
user
type
a
name
and
password.
Of
course,
for
kfs
this
could
be
sidestepped,
but
this
is
necessary
when
booting
from
a
real
file
server
on
the
network.
</p>

<a name="STARTUP" /><h3>STARTUP</h3>

<p class='para'>
When
a
Plan
9
machine
boots,
it
runs
the
configuration
script
/rc/bin/termrc
or
/rc/bin/cpurc,
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
terminal
or
a
CPU
server.
These
set
up
/dev
and
initialize
some
common
environment
variables,
in
particular
$fileserver.
This
variable
is
used
by
lp,
among
other
programs.
For
a
standalone
configuration,
this
should
be
kfs,
as
it
is
when
installed;
if
you
set
up
a
real
Plan
9
file
server
and
boot
over
the
network,
change
this
to
be
the
name
of
the
network
file
server.
