What
is
Plan
9?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
is
a
(relatively)
new
computer
operating
system
and
associated
utilities.
It
was
built
by
the
Computing
Science
Research
Center
of
Bell
Laboratories
(now
part
of
Alcatel-Lucent),
the
same
group
that
developed
Unix,
C,
and
C++.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
is
a
distributed
system,
able
to
make
use
of
different
kinds
of
resources
and
servers
spread
across
almost
any
network.
It
has
very
low
resource
requirement
compared
to
most
systems,
has
a
very
consistent,
simple
design,
and
performs
very
well.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
What
is
Inferno?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Inferno
is
a
spin-off
of
Plan
9
using
many
of
the
same
ideas
(and
much
of
the
same
code).
Inferno
has
several
additional
benefits;
even
lighter
resource
requirements,
a
virtual
machine
(Dis),
a
new
language
for
concurrent
programming
(Limbo),
and
the
ability
to
run
as
an
application
on
top
of
an
existing
Operating
System
(including
Plan
9,
Windows,
and
a
variety
of
Unixes).
</p>

<p class='para'>
This
FAQ
mostly
talks
about
Plan
9,
but
the
ideas
largely
translate
to
Inferno.
See
the
last
few
questions
for
some
Inferno-specific
information.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Why
do
people
use
it?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
answer
to
this
question
varies
by
user;
Plan
9
shows
up
in
lots
of
different
types
of
applications,
making
use
of
different
benefits.
It
is
used
in
embedded
systems,
where
the
low
overhead
is
important.
It
is
used
in
commercial
products
where
the
reliability
and
performance
are
important.
It's
used
in
massive
supercomputers
where
the
novel
interconnections
and
low
"system
noise"
are
needed.
What
you
get
out
of
it
largely
depends
on
what
you're
looking
for
from
it.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Most
frequently,
people
using
Plan
9
seem
to
focus
on
the
simplicity
of
the
system
and
the
great
distribution
mechanism.
This
later
idea,
in
particular,
is
very
central
to
Plan
9:
all
resources
are
represented
as
normal
files
(as
opposed
to
Unix,
where
most
things
are
files,
but
not
all
files
are
"real"
files),
and
the
system
uses
a
common
method
to
talk
to
them
all
(9P,
a.k.a.
Styx).
This,
and
related
points
like
the
fact
that
the
namespace
is
per-process,
affects
the
organization
of
the
entire
system,
leading
to
all
sorts
of
interesting,
novel
uses.
This
is
the
key
point
to
understand
in
Plan
9,
and
also
the
biggest
mental
jump
from
Unix
or
other
systems.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Why
don't
more
people
use
it?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
is
not
Unix
(or
anything
else
you're
likely
familiar
with).
While
the
command
set
is
superficially
similar,
it's
most
certainly
not
the
same
(cat
on
Unix
has
a
dozen
or
so
options;
on
Plan
9,
it
has
zero).
Many
people
come
to
Plan
9
expecting
unix++
or
similar,
and
are
disappointed
when
they
find
something
much
more
different
than
that.
Even
the
development
environment
is
similar
but
entirely
distinct:
we
use
mk,
not
make;
we
use
C,
but
the
library
isn't
ANSI
and
our
compilers
understand
some
C
extensions
that
aren't
in
GCC
(and
not
most
of
the
non-standard
ones
that
GCC
made
up);
the
default
preprocessor
is
much
simpler
than
ANSI's.
</p>

<p class='para'>
There
are
also
some
very
specific
issues
with
using
Plan
9
as
your
primary
OS,
mostly
relating
to
application
support.
We
don't
have
a
GUI
word
processor,
a
spreadsheet
program,
or
popular
games.
Most
notably,
we
don't
have
a
"modern"
web
browser
with
CSS
and
JavaScript
support
(but
see
the
question
about
some
of
those
below).
Plan
9
does
not
aim
to
replace
any
existing
desktop
system,
and
thus
using
it
has
a
higher
initial
bar
than
using
systems
which
do
try
to
fill
such
a
roll.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Is
there
much

<p class='para'>
The
Plan

is
small
but
active.
The
best
places
to
find
it
are
the
9fans
mailing

Several

in
both

more,

Read

<p class='para'>
Maybe.
Before
you
start,
remember
that
this
is
not
Unix;
first
look
for
the
Plan
9
way
of
solving
whatever
problem
it
is
your
Unix
application
is
addressing.
Source
or
binary
compatibility
with
Unix
has
never
been
a
design
goal
of
Plan
9,
so
every
solution
is
imperfect.
Still,
there
are
times
when
it's
needed,
so
there
are
solutions
which
work
well
in
many
cases.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you've
got
source
for
the
application,
it's
reasonably
self-contained,
and
reasonably
standards-compliant,
you've
got
a
good
shot
at
being
able
to
compile
it
within
Plan
9
using
APE,
the
ANSI/Posix
Environment.
This
gives
you
a
full
ANSI
C
pre-processor,
make,
a
POSIX
shell,
and
a
bunch
of
related
tools.
The
"configure"
script
for
some
applications
work
"out
of
the
box",
although
many
make
bad
assumptions
about
linux-specific
features.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
don't
have
the
source
or
building
it
on
Plan
9
is
otherwise
infeasable,
linuxemu
may
be
of
help.
This
will
emulate
enough
of
the
linux
kernel
and
system
call
interface
to
allow
a
wide
variety
of
linux
applications
to
run.
See
the
documentation
for
particular
shortcomings.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Related
to
the
above,
there
is
also
an
X11
server
for
Plan
9
called
equis.
It
is
available
from
fgb's
contrib
directory
(see
below).
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Can
I
run
KDE/GNOME/enlightenment/&amp;c?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Almost
certainly
not.
Remember:
Plan
9
is
not
Unix.
While
it's
true
that
we
have
APE
and
an
X11
environment
for
importing
foreign
applications
or
running
applications
on
Unix
systems
with
local
display,
very
large
programs
like
these
typically
have
a
slew
of
dependencies.
If
possible
at
all,
it
would
be
a
lot
of
work.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
spartan
nature
of
the
Plan
9
user
interface
is
one
of
the
first
things
which
strikes
newcomers.
There
are
no
desktop
icons,
almost
no
window
decoration,
no
configuration
files,
and
no
Start
menu.
The
simplistic
interface
is
not
due
to
lack
of
attention,
but
is
rather
a
conscious
design
decision.
The
Plan
9
interfaces
follow
a
"get
out
of
my
way"
philosophy
which,
in
many
ways,
runs
exactly
counter
to
the
common
desktop
environments
on
other
systems.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Can
I
run
Mozilla/Firefox/Opera/&amp;c?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
short
answer
is
"no";
the
long
answer
is
"kinda".
These
won't
run
on
Plan
9
directly,
but
you
might
have
good
luck
with
running
them
within
linuxemu.
Firefox,
Opera,
and
dillo,
at
least,
have
been
shown
to
work
this
way,
although
there
are
some
restrictions
on
which
version
of
glibc
they're
built
against.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Note
also
that
we
do
have
our
own
browsers,
but
they,
um...
let's
call
them
"basic".
In
Plan
9,
see
abaco;
in
Inferno,
see
Charon.
The
version
of
Charon
which
ships
with
<a href="http://www.caerwyn.com/acme/">acme-sac</a>
is
particularly
neat.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Do
I
need
multiple
computers
to
use
Plan
9?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
No,
certainly
not.
The
distributed
nature
of
Plan
9
-
allowing
resources
to
be
on
a
variety
of
hosts
across
a
network
-
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
run
those
services
on
the
same
host.
The
system
will,
for
the
most
part,
perform
exactly
the
same
with
your
authentication
server
on
your
box
versus
in
another
country,
for
example.
The
default
installation
sets
up
a
stand-alone
terminal
which
allows
you
to
get
at
most
of
the
interesting
features
of
Plan
9.
</p>

<p class='para'>
It
is
true
that
some
of
the
distributed
nature
of
Plan
9
shows
best
in
an
environment
with
multiple
computers.
In
particular,
separating
your
terminal
from
the
rest
of
the
system
is
of
particular
benefit,
but
many
combinations
are
possible.
You
can
add
systems
and
move
functions
incrementally
as
your
use
of
Plan

increases.

<p class='para'>
First
off,
if
you've
not
read
the
papers,
do
so.
They're
available
in
your
new
installation
under
/sys/doc,
as
well
as
online.
Particularly
useful
are
9.ps,
names.ps,
acme/acme.ps,
auth.ps,
fossil.ps,
and
plumb.ps,
in
roughly
that
order,
although
they're
all
worth
a
read.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Remember
that
this

not
Unix,
even
though
it
will
sometimes
feel
like
it.
Make
frequent
use

They're
both
more
concise
and
more
useful
than
on
most
Unix
systems.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You'll
want
to
create
a
user
for
yourself.
When
you're
just
on
your
terminal,
this
is
easy:
you
just
need
to
tell
fossil,
and
then
create
a
useful
default
environment
(with
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/newuser"><i>newuser</i>(8)</a>
or
/sys/lib/newuser).
It
gets
a
bit
more
complex
when
you
have
multiple
systems
involved;
see
auth/changeuser
in
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/auth"><i>auth</i>(8)</a>
for
details.

<ul>

<li>
So
now
let's
say
I
do
want
a
fuller
network;
how?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
default
installation
gives
you
a
terminal
running
with
a
local
file
system.
The
easiest
way
to
expand
this
is
to
turn
your
terminal
into
a
combined
cpu+file+authentication
server
and
add
a
terminal
booting
off
that
system.
Adding
additional
cpu
servers
then
becomes
trivial,
and
moving
authentication
to
a
dedicated
server
is
easy.

you're
a
good
C
programmer,
there's
lots
of
things
you
can
do
to
help.
We
can
always
use
more
driver
support.
Think
about
how
Plan
9
can
help
you
solve
a
particular
problem,
and
then
solve
it
and
share
the
results.
Write
documentation;
while
we
have
excellent
reference
material,
we're
not
so
great
on
"how
to"
documents
at
the
moment.
Take
notes
on
your
learning
process,
and
when
you're
a
bit
further
along,
turn
them
into
a
nice
getting
started
guide.
Scratch
an
itch.

<a name="NOT_USING_PLAN_9" /><h3>NOT USING PLAN 9</h3>

<ul>

<li>
It's
really
interesting,
but
I
don't
have
supported
hardware.
Options?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
First,
note
that
Plan
9
runs
well
in
a
variety
of
virtualization
systems,
including
Parallels,
VMWare,
Xen,
and
lguest.
If
hardware
support
is
your
primary
issue,
one
of
those
might
solve
your
problem.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
that's
not
an
option
for
whatever
reason,
and
you're
on
some
flavor
of
Unix
(including
Mac
OS
X),
check
out
9vx
-
a
Plan
9
kernel
running
as
an
application
above
Unix.
It's
not
as
stable
as
the
"real
thing"
and
has
a
few
quirks,
but
it
works
very
well
for
lots
of
cases.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
The
ideas
sound
great,
but
I
don't
want
a
whole
new
OS.
Options?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
You
can
get
at
many
of
the
Plan
9
ideas
without
actually
running
Plan
9.
The
most
complete
way
is
probably
Inferno,
which
in
addition
to
running
on
bare
hardware
can
run
as
an
application
on
top
of
an
existing
OS.
You'll
get
the
same
resource
distribution
mechanism,
the
same
great
clean
code,
and
many
of
the
same
tools,
and
Limbo
and
Dis
on
top
of
that.
In
fact,
Limbo
on
its
own
probably
makes
Inferno
worth
checking
out
regardless
of
what
you
end
up
doing
with
Plan
9
(remember
you
can
run
Inferno
on
top
of
Plan
9,
Unix,
or
Windows).
</p>

<p class='para'>
Beyond
that,
there
are
a
number
of
ways
to
get
at
bits
and
piecse
of
the
ideas
of
Plan
9
in
other
systems.
If
you're
interested
in
the
cleaner,
more
consistent
user
or
programming
environments,
check
out
Plan
9
from
User
Space,
a
port
of
many
of
the
Plan
9
tools
and
libraries
to
various
Unix-like
systems.
If
you're
interested
in
using
9P
to
distribute
resources,
check
out
v9fs,
a
Linux
kernel
module
implementing
9P,
or
one
of
the
many
9P
implementations
in
various
languages.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
How
can
I
help,
anyway?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
If
you're
using
one
of
the
alternatives
discussed
in
the
previous
few
questions,
there
are
still
good
ways
you
can
help.
If
you're
a
Unix
user,
particularly
a
Linux
user,
you
could
package
Plan
9
from
User
Space
or
Inferno
for
your
particular
system.
For
"extra
credit",
try
to
get
the
results
included
in
the
base
system.
If
you're
a
Windows
developer,
you
could
work
on
porting
9vx
or
Plan
9
from
User
Space
to
Windows.
And
if
you're
using
Inferno,
the
best
answers
are
largely
the
same
as
if
you're
using
Plan
9
itself:
the
best
contribution
is
to
use
the
system
to
solve
a
problem,
and
to
write,
code
and
documentation.
And
if
your'e
a
developer
in
some
language
other
than
C
or
Limbo,
it's
likely
that
we
could
use
work
on
the
9P/Styx
implemenation
in
that
language,
especially
authentication.
