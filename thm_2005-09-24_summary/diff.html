<a name="NEW_WEBSITE_/_WIKI_--_URIEL" /><h3>NEW WEBSITE / WIKI -- URIEL</h3>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="../Uriel">Uriel</a>
said,
that
the
new
design
for
the
main
Plan
9
website
was
started
after
the
last
THM.
</li>

<li>
The
link
for
the
design
he
showed
is:
http://glendy.se.cat-v.org/who/uriel/p9site/
</li>

<li>
One
of
the
main
ideas
behind
it
is,
that
most
of
the
links
direct
to
the
wiki,
so
people
can
change
its
content.
</li>

<li>
What
needs
to
be
done
is
to
fix
the
wiki,
so
its
style
looks
more
like
the
frontpage.
</li>

<li>
<a href="../Uriel">Uriel</a>
would
like
to
get
more
papers
into
the
"papers"
page.
</li>

<li>
Uriel
asked,
if
the
website
should
indicate,
that
there
were
changes
in
the
"Fourth
Edition"
of
Plan
9,
since
its
release.
</li>

<li>
Nemo
said,
that
it
is
still
the
"Fourth
Edition"
and
the
status
could
be
indicated
in
the
form
"vX/X/X".
</li>

<li>
Uriel
said
that
sources
was
unreliable
lately
and
so
more
mirrors
of
sources
are
needed.
</li>

<li>
Nemo
offered
a
fileserver,
web
and
9fs
access.
</li>

<li>
Uriel
told,
that
one
idea
behind
the
new
website
is
to
have
everything
in
sources,
so
it
can
be
mirrored.
</li>

<li>
Uriel
asked
for
help
with
the
"News"
wiki
page,
so
events,
like
the
Plan
B
release
are
written
down
there.
</li>

<li>
News
items
are
everything
and
if
someone
thinks,
that
it
is
not
news,
that
he/she
can
edit
the
wiki
page.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="INFERNO_WIKI_AND_CHAOS_(NOT_PLANNED)" /><h3>INFERNO WIKI AND CHAOS (NOT PLANNED)</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Uriel
asked
forsyth
about
the
plan,
to
have
a
business
oriented
and
hacker
style
website,
on
the
Inferno
mailinglist.
</li>

<li>
Forsyth
said,
that
the
wiki,
for
which
Caerwyn
volunteered,
should
be
the
hacker
style
website.
</li>

<li>
Uriel
asked,
if
Inferno
and
Plan
9
things
could
be
kept
centralized.
</li>

<li>
Forsyth
said,
that
he
does
not
disagree.
</li>

<li>
Nemo
asked
for
a
central
service
register.
</li>

<li>
Gdiaz
said,
that
the
9grid
nodes
could
be
used
for
that
role.
</li>

<li>
In
the
further
discussion
about
the
divergence
of
Plan
9
and
Inferno
drivers
was
a
new
model,
like
/sys/src/pc-drivers
</li>

<li>
chaos

<a name="9CON.MADRID_--_URIEL" /><h3>9CON.MADRID -- URIEL</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Uriel
hopes
to
show
up.
</li>

<li>
Nemo
said,
that
they
want
to
poll
the
university
to
get
support.
</li>

<li>
Two
options
were
given:
december
or
may
</li>

<li>
Uriel
said,
that
many
of
the
people
are
at
CCC
and
so
december
would
be
overkill.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="PLAN_B_--_NEMO" /><h3>PLAN B -- NEMO</h3>

<pre>
21:01 &lt;Nemo&gt; Well, we just wanted two things:
21:01 &lt;Nemo&gt; - avoid static mounts and let the system adapt to FS availability
21:02 &lt;Nemo&gt; - follow the "everything is a file" idea to the limit.
21:02 &lt;Nemo&gt; For example, I was disappointed because in rio I couldnt
21:02 &lt;Nemo&gt; use files to operate on widgets and the like.
21:02 &lt;Nemo&gt; In the same way, I couldn't copy an mp3 file to somewhere to make it play.
21:03 &lt;Nemo&gt; The same happen to other services. But most notably, the UI.
21:03 &lt;Nemo&gt; What we do is to announce resources to the network, and then mount them using our
21:04 &lt;Nemo&gt; volume stuff (dynamic mounts, really).
21:04 &lt;Nemo&gt; For example, mount -U /what /what
21:04 &lt;Nemo&gt; is what we use to get in /what
21:04 &lt;Nemo&gt; the union of all file trees for information about things.
21:04 &lt;Nemo&gt; A result is that you can ls /what to see what machines are around.
21:05 &lt;Nemo&gt; The same for other resources. For example, we use du to locate
21:05 &lt;Nemo&gt; things like button:Pause (pause buttons) in UIs found
21:05 &lt;Nemo&gt; at /devs/*ui/ or any other place.
21:05 &lt;Nemo&gt; Then we can 'echo press' &gt;/devs/....../button:Pause/ctl
21:06 &lt;Nemo&gt; to press the button. I think this gives the idea.
21:06 &lt;Nemo&gt; There are two things that are really useful: being able to import
21:07 &lt;Nemo&gt; resources without having to mount them by hand, and 2, having a
21:07 &lt;Nemo&gt; very detailed interface for services (having a file for the button).
</pre>

<ul>

<li>
Nemo
said,
that
he
wants
to
include
these
ideas
into
Plan
9.
</li>

<li>
He
said,
that
he
finished
volfs
for
Plan
9:
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
21:12 &lt;Nemo&gt; The daemon sends/listens for announces,
21:13 &lt;Nemo&gt; file servers register with /srv/vols to let volfs know that there's anew service.
21:13 &lt;Nemo&gt; (if you want to, of course)
21:13 &lt;Nemo&gt; So, your volfs knows of several FSs
21:13 &lt;Nemo&gt; that have a given name, and a set of constraints.
21:13 &lt;Nemo&gt; For example, /usr/nemo!Unemo!Lhome!Cok
21:14 &lt;Nemo&gt; which means, this thing is a file tree for "/usr/nemo"
21:14 &lt;Nemo&gt; that is owned by nemo, located at home (whatever that might mean), and the
21:14 &lt;Nemo&gt; latency of the connection from your machine to the FS seems to be good enough
21:14 &lt;Nemo&gt; to page-in binaries.
21:15 &lt;Nemo&gt; Well, the point is that volfs has the list of known volumes.
21:15 &lt;Nemo&gt; Then, you mount volumes from it:
21:15 &lt;Nemo&gt; mount /srv/vols /usr/nemo /usr/nemo!Cok
21:15 &lt;Nemo&gt; which means, you mount at /usr/nemo
21:15 &lt;Nemo&gt; the spec "/usr/nemo/!Cok".
21:16 &lt;Nemo&gt; The daemon takes care of supplying a file tree that matches your request.
</pre>

<ul>

<li>
Gdiaz
asked,
if
it
does
hot
swap.
</li>

<li>
Nemo
answered,
that
it
does
something
like
this,
as
you
request
a
"resource"
and
not
hold
just
the
fid.
</li>

<li>
Nemo
showed
examples
on
the
usage
of
volfs.
(See
the
logs.)
</li>
</ul>

<a name="AFTERSHOW" /><h3>AFTERSHOW</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Uriel
asked
about
kencc.
</li>

<li>
Forsyth
said,
that
he
is
working
on
the
tarball.
