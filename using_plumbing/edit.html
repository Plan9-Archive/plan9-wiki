Plumbing is a mechanism for passing messages between applications. It
has a customizable set of rules (see [plumb(6) |
http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/6/plumb]) to process
incoming messages and dispatch them to target applications.

The [plumber(4) |
http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/plumber] is the file
server that performs the message processing and dispatch.

It is up to each application how it wishes to use this mechanism, but
in the user-interface domain, the mechanism often allows the user to
point to a file-name or URL and have the associated resource
processed by an appropriate application.

EXAMPLES

In the rc shell window you can select or position the text cursor
inside a piece of text and press button 2 and select "plumb" from the
pop-up menu. Depending on what the text is, the plumber will perform
different actions. For example:

 *	a .ps, .pdf, or .dvi file name invokes the [page(1) |
	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/page] display program
 *	a .gif, .jpg, .png, .ppm file name also invokes page(1) to display
	them
 *	a compiler error message indicating a file and line number will
	invoke the default text editor to open the file at the given line
	number
 *	a .h file name will search /sys/include for the given header and
	opens it in the default text editor
 *	a man(1) page reference invokes man(1) for the appropriate page
 *	a URL opens the default browser for that page

The plumber can provide easy shortcuts for common functions. For
example, given a script 'web' which takes an argument of a URL to
open in a web browser, the plumbing rule:
! 	# RFC's from one of the nicer-looking repositories.
! 	type is text
! 	data matches 'RFC:([0-9]+)'
! 	plumb to web
! 	plumb start web http://rfc.sunsite.dk/rfc/rfc$1.html
will make RFC:2325 a link to some of the IETF's better work. A number
of other potentially useful [plumbing examples] have been collected.

A NICE TRICK

Namespaces in Plan 9 are local. That is, if you're inside an
application that has forked the namespace, you can't change the
namespace visible to other applications. In particular, you can't
mount a remote file server and then plumb it to another running
application. Here's a neat trick that lets you do that.

! 	srvfs plumbspace /n
! 	plumber
! 	rfork n
! 	mount -b /srv/plumbspace /n

Put this in your /lib/profile (before rio is started) and /n is now
an indirect part of the namespace that can be changed in all
applications by the plumber. An extra rule in the plumber is all
that's needed to make use of it:

! type is text
! data matches 'Local (.*)'
! plumb to none
! plumb start rc -c $1

For example, say I wished to mount a local kfs disk and edit a file
in it. I can open a new shell window, type:

! disk/kfs
! plumb 'Local mount /srv/kfs /n/kfs'

and the files on the new disk will be visible to all applications on
the machine, including, for example, an existing incarnation of Acme.

PLUMBING BETWEEN MACHINES ON A GRID

The plumber is a good example of the power of network transparency in
Plan 9. On a well-connected grid, the plumber will naturally act to
dispatch messages to applications running on the correct machine.
Consider a small grid of 3 machines: terminal, file/cpu/auth, and tcp
boot cpu. The user's primary work environment is via cpu(1) to the
file/cpu/auth server. A web browser runs on the terminal, and an
acme(1) editing and compiling environment runs in a separate cpu(1)
session to the tcp boot cpu server.

As the user works within the primary cpu workspace, plumbed messages
will find the correct destination automatically. Messages of url form
will be received by the browser running on the local terminal and
links will open there, messages referencing source code files will be
received by the editor and appear for editing and compilation on the
tcp boot cpu, and messages for applications running on the main cpu
will be processed there.

The necessary condition for this correct message dispatch between
nodes is simply that all applications running on the grid have a
connection to the plumber within their namespace, and have a view of
file namespace which allows them to access any necessary resources.
Programs which the user is interacting with directly should
automatically have the plumber available at /mnt/plumb or
/mnt/term/mnt/plumb; other programs will need to mount the user's
plumber from /srv, possibly after an import(4) of the /srv of the
machine hosting the plumber.
