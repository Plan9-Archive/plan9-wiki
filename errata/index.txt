Errata

Various known bugs and problems:

 *	ms2html(1) produces seriously broken output for various inputs.
	Use htmlroff(1) instead.
 *	acme: Copy chord doesn't work in tag bar
 *	fossil: Allowing your fossil partition to fill completely can be
	dangerous. [Discussion of issue and possible solutions. |
	http://9fans.net/archive/2005/12/124]
 *	gif: animated gifs are drawn on a black background rather than on
	the previous animated frame. [Example (appologies for the quality of
	the joke) |

 *	replica(1) doesn't log the difference between a file and a dir so
	if a replica'ed object changes from one to the other madness ensues.
 *	The auto-completion feature (INS or CTRL-F in 9term) doesn't work
	inside subtrees mounted after the plumber was started; see
	plumber(4).

APE BUGS

 *	sed: if no trailing new line there is no output. Newlines are
	terminators, not separators; a text file without a final newline is
	malformed and you get undefined results. eg.,:
! # echo foo |sed 's/o/x/'
! fxo
! # echo -n foo |sed 's/o/x/'
! #
