To

up

it
might
be
nice
to

what
people
can
contribute
to
the
program
(tell
about
or
show),
and
what
people
would
like
to
consume
(learn,
hear
about

wether

be
able

depend
very
much
on

<p class='para'>
Cost:
</p>

<p class='para'>
For
the
meeting
itself
I
anticipate
no
costs,
but
all
I
offer
for
that
is
the
place
to
meet,
some
coffee,
tea
during
the
meeting,
and
lunches
(dutch
``second
breakfast''
style
-
bread
etc)
(I
succeeded
to
arrange
some
funding
for
lunches
and
refreshments).
I
expect
each
to
book
his
own
accomodation
and
(apart
from
lunches)
pay
his
own
food
in
the
university
cafetaria
etc.
Also,
both
mechiel
and
I
have
some
space
for
``mattrass
on
the
floor''
guests;
if
you
are
interested
contact
us
(or
me,
axel)
in
time.

you
have
