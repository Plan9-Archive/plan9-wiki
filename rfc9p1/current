#
#.ce A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers
#
#.ti 0 Status of this Memo
#
#.fi .in 3 This memo describes an experimental method for the
#encapsulation of IP datagrams in avian carriers. This specification
#is primarily useful in Metropolitan Area Networks. This is an
#experimental, not recommended standard. Distribution of this memo is
#unlimited.
#
#.ti 0 Overview and Rational
#
#Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
#altitude service. The connection topology is limited to a single
#point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
#but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
#each other, outside of early spring. This is because of the 3D ether
#space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
#IEEE802.3. The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
#system, which increases availability. Unlike some network
#technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
#line-of-sight distance. Connection oriented service is available in
#some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.
#
#.ti 0 Frame Format
#
#The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in
#hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
#The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
#A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges. The
#bandwidth is limited to the leg length. The MTU is variable, and
#paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age. A
#typical MTU is 256 milligrams. Some datagram padding may be needed.
#
#Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
#datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
#form.
#
#.ti 0 Discussion
#
#Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking
#order. An additional property is built-in worm detection and
#eradication. Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss
#of a carrier can be tolerated. With time, the carriers are
#self-regenerating. While broadcasting is not specified, storms can
#cause data loss. There is persistent delivery retry, until the
#carrier drops. Audit trails are automatically generated, and can
#often be found on logs and cable trays.
#
#.ti 0 Security Considerations
#
#.in 3 Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but
#special measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian
#carriers are used in a tactical environment.
