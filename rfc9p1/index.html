This
memo
describes
an
experimental
method
for
the
encapsulation
of
IP
datagrams
in
avian
carriers.
This
specification
is
primarily
useful
in
Metropolitan
Area
Networks.
This
is
an
experimental,
not
recommended
standard.
Distribution
of
this
memo
is

Overview
and
Rational
</p>

<p class='para'>
Avian
carriers
can
provide
high
delay,
low
throughput,
and
low
altitude
service.
The
connection
topology
is
limited
to
a
single
point-to-point
path
for
each
carrier,
used
with
standard
carriers,
but
many
carriers
can
be
used
without
significant
interference
with
each
other,
outside
of
early
spring.
This
is
because
of
the
3D
ether
space
available
to
the
carriers,
in
contrast
to
the
1D
ether
used
by
IEEE802.3.
The
carriers
have
an
intrinsic
collision
avoidance
system,
which
increases
availability.
Unlike
some
network
technologies,
such
as
packet
radio,
communication
is
not
limited
to
line-of-sight
distance.
Connection
oriented
service
is
available
in
some
cities,
usually
based
upon
a
central
hub
topology.

Frame
Format
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
IP
datagram
is
printed,
on
a
small
scroll
of
paper,
in
hexadecimal,
with
each
octet
separated
by
whitestuff
and
blackstuff.
The
scroll
of
paper
is
wrapped
around
one
leg
of
the
avian
carrier.
A
band
of
duct
tape
is
used
to
secure
the
datagram's
edges.
The
bandwidth
is
limited
to
the
leg
length.
The
MTU
is
variable,
and
paradoxically,
generally
increases
with
increased
carrier
age.
A
typical
MTU
is
256
milligrams.
Some
datagram
padding
may
be
needed.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Upon
receipt,
the
duct
tape
is
removed
and
the
paper
copy
of
the
datagram
is
optically
scanned
into
a
electronically
transmittable
form.

Discussion

<p class='para'>
Multiple
types
of
service
can
be
provided
with
a
prioritized
pecking
order.
An
additional
property
is
built-in
worm
detection
and
eradication.
Because
IP
only
guarantees
best
effort
delivery,
loss
of
a
carrier
can
be
tolerated.
With
time,
the
carriers
are
self-regenerating.
While
broadcasting
is
not
specified,
storms
can
cause
data
loss.
There
is
persistent
delivery
retry,
until
the
carrier
drops.
Audit
trails
are
automatically
generated,
and
can
often
be
found
on
logs
and
cable
trays.

Security
is
not
generally
a
problem
in
normal
operation,
but
special
measures
must
be
taken
(such
as
data
encryption)
when
avian
carriers
are
used
in
a
tactical
environment.
