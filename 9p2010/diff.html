<a name="MOTIVATION" /><h3>MOTIVATION</h3>

<p class='para'>
In
my
use
of
9P
within
the
Linux
and
IBM
communities
there
have
been
several
requests
for
extensions
to
better
support
Linux
environments
or
features
not
currently
a
part
of
the
protocol
(locking,
caching,
batch
operations,
storage
networking,
etc.)
As
such,
I'd
like
to
work
towards
a
specification
of
the
protocol
which
can
accomodate
these
extensions
in
as
non-intrusive
a
way
as
possible
(the
counter-example
being
9P2000.u
which
while
negotiated
ends
up
complicating
clients
and
servers
who
wish
to
use
it).
</p>

<a name="BASICS" /><h3>BASICS</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
core
protocol
(size
prefix,
operation,
tag)
remains
the
same.
The
existing
9P2000
operations
remain
the
same,
9P2000.u
will
be
depricated
by
the
new
extension
model.
Extensions
will
exist
in
a
complimentary
namespace
--
that
is
to
say
operation
identifiers
will
not
overlap
with
existing
operations,
and
all
extensions
will
use
new
operations
as
opposed
to
changes
to
existing
operations.
Alternate
extension
op-codes
spaces
may
be
negotiated
by
optional
prefixes
during
Tversion
negotiation
--
but
every
effort
will
be
made
to
keep
operations
within
the
existing
namespace.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
extensions
are
OPTIONAL,
servers
which
don't
wish
to
implement
them
(or
any
subset
of
them)
simply
returns
Rerror
--
well
behaved
clients
will
fall
back
to
the
core
9P2000
operations.
</p>

<a name="OPERATION_CODE_RESERVATION" /><h3>OPERATION CODE RESERVATION</h3>

<p class='para'>
To
facilitate
complimentary
extensions,
we'll
use
a
wiki
page
<a href="../9P2010_Operations">9P2010
Operations</a>
to
coordinate
op-code
reservation
for
specific
extensions.
It
will
be
the
definitive
registration
resource
for
the
time
being.
