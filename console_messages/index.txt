Console messages

The fossil fileserver currently (March 2006) prints some
informational messages on the system console from time to time:

! could not write super block; waiting 10 seconds
! blistAlloc: called on clean block

! flushthread found nothing to flush - 2 dirty

These should not be cause for concern.

A fossil based terminal may print these messages in VGA text mode
``behind'' the users rio session thus corrupting the users display.
This may be prevented by collecting the messages in a single window
by running:

!  cat /dev/kprint
