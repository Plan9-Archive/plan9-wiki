NOTE:
VirtualBox
is
not
a
very
good
choice.
Behavior
changes
dramatically
from
release
to
release,
with
some
working
out
of
the
box,
some
needing
just
the
right
settings,
and
some
not
working
at
all.
You
are
highly
encouraged
to
pick
a
different
VM.
VMware,
qemu
(with
or
without
kqemu),
kvm,
and
xen
are
all
known
to
work
better.

Below
are
a
few
reports
of
an
installation
that
worked.
For
people
who
are
attached
to

for
one
reason
or
another,
it
might
be
useful
to
produce
a
table
of
"Plan

VBox
version
/
host
OS
version"
tuples
with
a
brief

Bell Labs Plan 9 and networking works well in virtualbox 3.1.8 using
Am79C973 virtual ethernet adapter in bridged mode, chipset PIIX3
selected and "Enable IO APIC" turned off.  (Maybe not the only usable
settings but these work for me.)
</pre>
<hr />Under
Virtual
Box
3.0,
selecting
the
ICH6
chipset
rather
than
PIIX3
or
PIIX4,
and
deselecting
all
disks
allows
9pccpu
to
run.
AMD79C970
Ethernet
PXE
boots
reliably
but
the
Intel
Ethernet
emulations
don't.<hr />I
used
a
VirtualBox-4.1.10
for
my
installation
on
a
Gentoo
Linux
host,
to
get
a
first
look
into
plan9.
<p class='para'>
The
basic
installation
works
out
of
the
box,
simply
creating
a
VirtualBox
System
of
type
"Other",
choosing
a
tiny
splitter
of
memory
(512M)
and
a
little
disk
to
hold
the
system
(2G),
which
I
decided
to
reside
as
a
fixed
size
image.
</p>

<p class='para'>
(Maybe
I
will
do
a
video
on
howto
setup
that
VirtualBox
image,
later).<hr />

Actually
setting
up
a
plan9
from
the
latest
iso
from
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/download/">Download</a>
Page
was
quite
simple.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
You
have
to
choose
an
IDE
Controller
(which
is
the
default)
with
the
VDI
(VirtualBox
Disk
Image)
as
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
IDE Controller
   IDE Primary Master:                  plan 9.vdi (Normal, 2,00 GB)
</pre>

<ul>

<li>
And
you
use
the
unpacked
and
downloaded
ISO
Image
as
Secondary
Master
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
   IDE Secondary Master (CD/DVD):       plan9.iso (277,21 MB)
</pre>

<ul>

<li>
I
leave
it
to
you
to
figure
out
and
continue
the
installation
process,
after
booting
the
System
and
choosing
to
Install
the
Plan9
System,
as
most
things
just
work
as
default
or
are
documented
somewhere
else
...
until
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
This
one:
It
took
me
over
a
day
of
sweat,
blood
and
tears
to
get
the
network
running.
Actually
the
PCNet
adapters
don't
seem
to
work
at
all.
I
found
just
this
one
Network
setting
to
be
good:
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
Adapter 1: Intel PRO/1000 MT Server (Bridged adapter, eth0)
</pre>

<p class='para'>
where
the
`MT
Server'
version
is
absolutely
essential,
as
the
MT
Desktop
version
does
not
work!
</p>

<ul>

<li>
After
using
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ipconfig"><i>ipconfig</i>(8)</a>
the
dhcp
of
my
router
box
gave
me
a
valid
IP
in
the
local
network
and
provided
the
plan9
client
system
with
valid
DNS
Servers
in
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
cat /net/ndb
ip=192.168.122.6 ipmask=255.255.255.0 ipgw=192.168.122.254
	sys=gnot
	dns=192.168.1.3
	dns=192.168.1.9
</pre>

<ul>

<li>
I
made
that
settings
boot
save
by
uncommenting
the
dedicated
(ip/ipconfig)
lines
in
</li>
</ul>

<pre>
/bin/termrc

That's
it
folks.
Let

begin!

<a name="TO_SETUP_A_CUSTOM_VIDEO_MODE" /><h3>TO SETUP A CUSTOM VIDEO MODE</h3>

<p class='para'>
VirtualBox
provides
a
vesa
display
emulation
to
control
video
modes
of
the
guest.
You
might
observe,
that
your
(modern)
monitors
resolution,
i.e.
1680x1050x32
or
1920x1080x32,
as
in
my
case,
are
not
supported.
</p>

<p class='para'>
These
are
not
originally
vesa
modes,
which
is
a
quite
old
standard.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Luckily
you
are
able
to
tune
your
host
system
to
provide
extended
vesa
modes
for
the
guest.
The
method
is
described
in
the
<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html">VirtualBox
manual</a>,
in
the
section
“Custom
Vesa
Resolutions”.
</p>

<p class='para'>
All
you
have
to
do
is
to
set
your
custom
modes
as
extradata
options:
</p>

<pre>
VirtualBox setextradata "VM name" "CustomVideoMode1" "1920x1080x32"
VirtualBox setextradata "VM name" "CustomVideoMode2" "1680x1050x32"
VirtualBox setextradata "VM name" "CustomVideoMode3" "960x1080x32"
</pre>
