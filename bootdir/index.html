bootdir</h1>

<div class='body'> <!-- ***************************** -->

In
Mid
December
2002,
a
new
feature
was
added
to
the
system.
It
changes
the
previous
#//boot
to
be
a
directory
rather
than
a
file,
and
allows
what
used
to
be
a
binary
that
had
to
be
compiled
to
be
a
script
instead.
<p class='para'>
Russ
Cox
said
something
like
this
in
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=606456fcdc17ce997666a1895d86f9ba%40plan9.bell-labs.com">http://groups.google.com/groups?dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=606456fcdc17ce997666a1895d86f9ba%40plan9.bell-labs.com</a>
</p>

<p class='para'>
There
is
a
new
kernel
config
file
section
called
"bootdir"
that
lists
the
files
to
be
placed
in
#//boot.
There
are
no
binaries
in
#/
itself
anymore.
</p>

<p class='para'>
A
typical
bootdir
section
might
look
like
</p>

<pre>
	bootdir
		bootpcdisk.out boot
		/386/bin/ip/ipconfig
		/386/bin/auth/factotum
		/386/bin/disk/kfs
		/386/bin/cfs
</pre>

<p class='para'>
which
says
that
/boot
will
contain
four
files:
boot,
ipconfig,
factotum,
kfs,
and
cfs,
copied
from
the
listed
paths.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
kernels
have
always
special
cased
boot$CONF.out
to
get
it
listed
as
/boot.
It
is
now
/boot/boot,
and
no
longer
a
special
case.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
that
everything
is
in
/boot,
initcode
had
to
change
for
all
the
kernels;
/boot/boot
itself
had
to
change
to
exec
/boot/ipconfig
(instead
of
/ipconfig),
etc.
Finally,
auth_getkey
changed.
It
looks
for
/factotum
and
then
/boot/factotum,
to
deal
with
either
type
of
kernel.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
boot
file
/386/bin/ip/ipconfig
(e.g.)
turns
into
_386_bin_ip_ipconfig.root.s
and
then
_386_bin_ip_ipconfig.root.8.
It's
a
bit
of
an
ugly
name,
but
mk
clean
will
get
rid
of
them.
You
could
imagine
just
using
the
last
path
element,
but
that
might
lead
to
weird
build
inconsistencies
if
kernels
were
using
two
different
files
with
the
same
last
element.
One
unfortunate
consequence
of
the
big
name
is
that
_386_bin_auth_factotum.root.s
is
too
long
for
the
current
file
servers
to
deal
with.
You
could
use
lnfs
to
get
around
this,
but
I
didn't
want
to
require
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/lnfs"><i>lnfs</i>(4)</a>
for
the
kernel
build,
so
we
have
a
rule
in
portmkfile
that
copies
factotum
and
ipconfig
to
factotum.hack
and
ipconfig.hack
and
then
the
bootdir
section
actually
looks
like:
</p>

<pre>
	bootdir
		bootpcdisk.out boot
		ipconfig.hack ipconfig
		factotum.hack factotum
		/386/bin/disk/kfs
		/386/bin/cfs
</pre>

<p class='para'>
sadly.
That
will
go
away
when
we
get
long
file
names.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
pc
initcode
is
also
changed.
Whereas
before
it
used
to
do
</p>

<pre>
	exec("/boot", ["boot", 0]);
</pre>

<p class='para'>
in
hand-coded
assembly
(pc/initcode.s),
it
now
does
</p>

<pre>
	open("#c/cons", OREAD);
	open("#c/cons", OWRITE);
	open("#c/cons", OWRITE);
	bind("#c", "/dev", MAFTER);
	bind("#ec", "/env", MAFTER);
	bind("#e", "/env", MCREATE|MAFTER);
	bind("#s", "/srv", MREPL|MCREATE);
	execl("/boot/boot", "/boot/boot", 0);
</pre>

<p class='para'>
in
C
(port/initcode.c).
The
point
is
to
set
up
enough
of
a
namespace
that
/boot/boot
can
be
a
shell
script.
Eventually
the
other
architectures
should
change
too,
though
it's
not
urgent.
If
someone
wants
to
do
the
bitsy,
send
me
mail
and
I'll
let
you
know
what
it
took
to
get
one
of
the
old
undistributed
mips
kernels
changed
over.
(The
compiler
setup
is
similar.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
As
a
much
bigger
example,
I
built
a
kernel
called
pcext
the
other
night.
It
uses
rx
and
trampoline
to
connect
through
a
Plan
9
gateway
machine
to
the
root
file
server.
It
uses
this
bootdir:
</p>

<pre>
	bootdir
		bootext boot
		/386/bin/rc
		/rc/lib/rcmain
		/386/bin/bind
		/386/bin/cat
		/386/bin/cp
		/386/bin/echo
		/386/bin/mount
		/386/bin/sleep
		factotum.hack factotum
		/386/bin/ip/ipconfig
		/386/bin/cfs
		/386/bin/aux/srvthru
</pre>

<p class='para'>
(and
does
require
lnfs
to
build).
</p>

<p class='para'>
Srvthru
is
the
obvious
program
--
it
connects
to
rx,
authenticates,
starts
trampoline
to
the
real
file
server,
and
then
optionally
pushes
cfs
onto
the
connection.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
point
is
that
bootext
is
a
shell
script,
which
makes
it
easier
to
tweak
than
when
/boot
was
a
binary
building
out
of
/sys/src/9/boot.
</p>

<pre>
	#!/boot/rc -m /boot/rcmain
	
	cd /boot
	cp '#r/rtc' '#c/time'
	bind -a /boot /bin
	bind -a '#I' /net
	bind -a '#l0' /net
	bind -a '#S' /dev
	bind '#p' /proc
	bind '#d' /fd
	bind -a /boot /
	ipconfig
	echo 'authdom=cs.bell-labs.com auth=204.178.31.3' &gt;&gt;/net/ndb
	factotum -sfactotum -u -a 204.178.31.3
	cargs=()
	if(~ $#cfs 1 &amp;&amp; ! ~ $cfs off)
		cargs=(-c $cfs)
	srvthru $cargs tcp!204.178.31.2!17009 il!emelie!9fs boot emelie
	mount -c /srv/boot /root
	bind -ac /root /
	bind -c /root/mnt /mnt
	mount -a '#s/factotum' /mnt
	rootdir=/root
	rootspec=''
	/386/init -t
	/boot/rc -m/boot/rcmain -i	# in case init fails
</pre>

<p class='para'>
It
takes
care
of
everything
/boot
traditionally
does,
using
srvthru
as
the
way
to
establish
/srv/boot
(and
also
/srv/emelie,
just
for
kicks).
