In Mid December 2002, a new feature was added to the system. It
changes the previous #//boot to be a directory rather than a file,
and allows what used to be a binary that had to be compiled to be a
script instead.

Russ Cox said something like this in
[http://groups.google.com/groups?dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=606456fcdc17ce997666a1895d86f9ba%40plan9.bell-labs.com]

There is a new kernel config file section called "bootdir" that lists
the files to be placed in #//boot. There are no binaries in #/ itself
anymore.

A typical bootdir section might look like

! 	bootdir
! 		bootpcdisk.out boot
! 		/386/bin/ip/ipconfig
! 		/386/bin/auth/factotum
! 		/386/bin/disk/kfs
! 		/386/bin/cfs

which says that /boot will contain four files: boot, ipconfig,
factotum, kfs, and cfs, copied from the listed paths.

The kernels have always special cased boot$CONF.out to get it listed
as /boot. It is now /boot/boot, and no longer a special case.

Now that everything is in /boot, initcode had to change for all the
kernels; /boot/boot itself had to change to exec /boot/ipconfig
(instead of /ipconfig), etc. Finally, auth_getkey changed. It looks
for /factotum and then /boot/factotum, to deal with either type of
kernel.

The boot file /386/bin/ip/ipconfig (e.g.) turns into
_386_bin_ip_ipconfig.root.s and then _386_bin_ip_ipconfig.root.8.
It's a bit of an ugly name, but mk clean will get rid of them. You
could imagine just using the last path element, but that might lead
to weird build inconsistencies if kernels were using two different
files with the same last element. One unfortunate consequence of the
big name is that _386_bin_auth_factotum.root.s is too long for the
current file servers to deal with. You could use lnfs to get around
this, but I didn't want to require lnfs(4) for the kernel build, so
we have a rule in portmkfile that copies factotum and ipconfig to
factotum.hack and ipconfig.hack and then the bootdir section actually
looks like:

! 	bootdir
! 		bootpcdisk.out boot
! 		ipconfig.hack ipconfig
! 		factotum.hack factotum
! 		/386/bin/disk/kfs
! 		/386/bin/cfs

sadly. That will go away when we get long file names.

The pc initcode is also changed. Whereas before it used to do

! 	exec("/boot", ["boot", 0]);

in hand-coded assembly (pc/initcode.s), it now does

! 	open("#c/cons", OREAD);
! 	open("#c/cons", OWRITE);
! 	open("#c/cons", OWRITE);
! 	bind("#c", "/dev", MAFTER);
! 	bind("#ec", "/env", MAFTER);
! 	bind("#e", "/env", MCREATE|MAFTER);
! 	bind("#s", "/srv", MREPL|MCREATE);
! 	execl("/boot/boot", "/boot/boot", 0);

in C (port/initcode.c). The point is to set up enough of a namespace
that /boot/boot can be a shell script. Eventually the other
architectures should change too, though it's not urgent. If someone
wants to do the bitsy, send me mail and I'll let you know what it
took to get one of the old undistributed mips kernels changed over.
(The compiler setup is similar.)

As a much bigger example, I built a kernel called pcext the other
night. It uses rx and trampoline to connect through a Plan 9 gateway
machine to the root file server. It uses this bootdir:

! 	bootdir
! 		bootext boot
! 		/386/bin/rc
! 		/rc/lib/rcmain
! 		/386/bin/bind
! 		/386/bin/cat
! 		/386/bin/cp
! 		/386/bin/echo
! 		/386/bin/mount
! 		/386/bin/sleep
! 		factotum.hack factotum
! 		/386/bin/ip/ipconfig
! 		/386/bin/cfs
! 		/386/bin/aux/srvthru

(and does require lnfs to build).

Srvthru is the obvious program -- it connects to rx, authenticates,
starts trampoline to the real file server, and then optionally pushes
cfs onto the connection.

The point is that bootext is a shell script, which makes it easier to
tweak than when /boot was a binary building out of /sys/src/9/boot.

! 	#!/boot/rc -m /boot/rcmain
! 	
! 	cd /boot
! 	cp '#r/rtc' '#c/time'
! 	bind -a /boot /bin
! 	bind -a '#I' /net
! 	bind -a '#l0' /net
! 	bind -a '#S' /dev
! 	bind '#p' /proc
! 	bind '#d' /fd
! 	bind -a /boot /
! 	ipconfig
! 	echo 'authdom=cs.bell-labs.com auth=204.178.31.3' >>/net/ndb
! 	factotum -sfactotum -u -a 204.178.31.3
! 	cargs=()
! 	if(~ $#cfs 1 && ! ~ $cfs off)
! 		cargs=(-c $cfs)
! 	srvthru $cargs tcp!204.178.31.2!17009 il!emelie!9fs boot emelie
! 	mount -c /srv/boot /root
! 	bind -ac /root /
! 	bind -c /root/mnt /mnt
! 	mount -a '#s/factotum' /mnt
! 	rootdir=/root
! 	rootspec=''
! 	/386/init -t
! 	/boot/rc -m/boot/rcmain -i	# in case init fails

It takes care of everything /boot traditionally does, using srvthru
as the way to establish /srv/boot (and also /srv/emelie, just for
kicks).
