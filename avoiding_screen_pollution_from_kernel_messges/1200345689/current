Avoiding Screen Pollution from Kernel Messges

#Don't you just hate it when kernel messages pollute your display in
#the form of those annoying black rectangles overlaid above whatever
#you're working on? This is a known bug in rio(1); for further
#detail, see Rob Pike's [message |
#http://9fans.net/archive/2000/10/203] to this effect.
#
#To work around this problem, open a new terminal window and do:
#
#! cat /dev/kprint
#
#This works because, according to the kprint discussion in cons(3),
#"if (the) console is a graphics screen, the data is sent either to
#the display or to kprint, but not both."
#
#Another more permanent solution to the problem is to put
#
#! cat /dev/kprint >/dev/null >[2=1]
#
#somewhere in termrc (see cpurc(8)).
