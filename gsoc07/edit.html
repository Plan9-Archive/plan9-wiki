STUDENTS

Plan 9 is an excellent environment to learn about many aspects of
computing: operating systems, distributed systems, programming
languages, network protocols, etc.

Plan 9 is not a difficult environment, and simplicity and elegance
are its main qualities, but it is very *different* from anything else
you might be used to!

Fundamental requirements:

 *	A very open mind to explore and embrace very different concepts
	and environments.
 *	You must enjoy challenges that stretch your preconceptions to
	their limits.

General recommended skills:

 *	Understanding of basic Unix principles and philosophy (but note
	that Plan 9 is *not* Unix. Plan 9 is meant to *replace* Unix.)
 *	Some programming experience, ideally with C, but other languages
	are fine.

Recommended Reading

 *	[The Plan 9 Documentation |
	http://cm.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/index.html], particularly the [Plan
	9 from Bell Labs | http://cm.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/9.html] intro.
 *	[The Inferno Operating System |
	http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/bltj.html], [A Descent into
	Limbo | http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/descent.html] by
	Brian W. Kernighan and [The Limbo Programming Language |
	http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/limbo.html] by Dennis M.
	Ritchie.
 *	Rob Pike's [comments on style |
	http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html], as well as Russ Cox's
	[more recent ones | http://swtch.com/~rsc/worknotes/]
 *	The Practice of Programming, and The UNIX Programming Environment,
	by Brian W. Kernighan, and Rob Pike, published by Addison-Wesley.
 *	The [recommended readings] wiki page

PROJECTS

We like to find a project that ideally suit the students who take
them on. For that reason we are very happy to hear (on #plan9-gsoc on
Freenode or the [plan9-gsoc |
http://groups.google.com/group/plan9-gsoc] Google group) your
particular areas of interest and expertise. Because Plan 9 is a
complete system, which expands beyond a single OS, no matter what
your interests, we should be able to find a project that makes you
happy (we know that happy developers make for happy projects).

Here is a list of project ideas we have come up with as examples,
Even if they seem complex and difficult, they are likely much simpler
than you think. In Plan 9 everything is simpler ;)

Misc:

 *	New window manager different from rio(1), experiment with new
	window management ideas.
 *	CSS rendering for abaco web browser
 *	General purpose boot loader based on Plan 9 kernel and /dev/reboot
 *	[Zeroconf | http://www.zeroconf.org] network configuration support
	(ideally, with a Plan 9 or Inferno twist)
 *	Framework of scripts and tools to automatically detect and
	configure hardware (screen resolution, keyboard, mouse, etc.)
 *	Reincarnation of 'pico' image manipulation language, or native
	graphics functions like those in NetPBM.
 *	Documentation framework: a set of scripts to check that all man
	pages and other documentation is up to date and in sync with tools
	and APIs. And some way to manage and organize a centralized
	documentation 'handbook' and FAQ.

Security:
 *	Ssh2 client/server (complete native implementation or port a new
	one from another system.)
 *	Add support for Inferno auth to Plan 9.

File servers (for Plan 9 or Inferno, but probably best implemented in
Limbo):

 *	fs interface to a version control system(gitfs, hgfs or svnfs;
	cvsfs already exists.)
 *	Ircfs or imfs.
 *	Bugfs: a bug tracking system with an fs interface.
 *	webdavfs.
 *	rssfs/webfeedfs.
 *	ldapfs.
 *	iPodfs.
 *	cdfs(4) support for writting DVDs.
 *	bluetoothfs.

Port of foreign applications to Plan 9:

 *	Video player (eg., port mplayer).
 *	Update GCC port and have it accepted upstream.
 *	Update X11 port.
 *	Update python port.
 *	Port Erlang.
 *	Update [APE | http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/ape.html] to be a
	more complete POSIX environment.
 *	Finish qemu port. Work on this project would require a good
	understanding of x86 assembly language and interest in learning [a
	non-gcc dialect of C | http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/comp.html].

Kernel related work:

 *	Write a driver for a piece of hardware of your choice (eg.,
	[finish ipw2200 wireless driver |
	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/contrib/rsc/ipw2200/])
 *	OLPC port.
 *	Profile and optimize a kernel component of your choice (IP stack,
	vm, ...)
 *	Increase "dynamicity" of network stack, including [detaching
	devices in kernel |
	http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/8d847c80107e3f34]
	and appropriate user-space reactivity (e.g., dhcpclient deciding
	whether to re-bind or destroy an existing network stack, for
	possible inspiration see [Plan B /net paper |
	http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/9476/30062/01377320.pdf?tp=&arnumber=1377320&isnumber=30062]). The kernel part and the user-space part are probably each large enough to qualify as independent projects.
 *	Update SPARC or MIPS ports.
 *	Kernel regresion and stress testing framework.

[9P | http://cat-v.org/9p/] related projects:

 *	fs driver for Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, BeOS, or any other
	operating system (for projects related to the existing Linux driver
	see [v9fs | http://swik.net/v9fs/Summer+of+Code+2007+Ideas]).
 *	9P implementation in your favorite programming language.
 *	A framework to test the interoperativity of all existings 9P
	implementations.
 *	Implement a 9P interface to your favorite (non-plan9) application.
 *	Implement 9P extension for 'batch requests' and improve
	performance over high latency links.
 *	9P implementation in JavaScript, so that a browser can access
	resources sensibly (ie, not using HTTP/XML).

[Inferno | http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/bltj.html] and
[Limbo | http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/limbo.html]:

 *	Complete 'native' [dis |
	http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/hotchips.html] and improve
	Inferno/Plan 9 integration so Inferno apps work like native Plan 9
	apps.
 *	Improve Inferno integration with Unix or Windows host OSes (allow
	Inferno apps to be managed by native window manager, etc.)
 *	A [fossil |
	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html?man=fossil]-like ([paper |
	http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/fossil.pdf]) snapshot file
	server in Limbo using [venti |
	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/venti.html] as backend.
 *	Port [Omero | http://lsub.org/ls/export/omero.pdf] to Limbo.
 *	PS3 port w/ppe file system interfaces and support for ps3 devices
	(controllers) - either hosted on Linux and/or native on the PS3
	hypervisor.
 *	Finish Gumstix port.
 *	Port [Inferno-plugin | http://code.google.com/p/inferno-plugin/]
	to Mozilla/Firefox.
 *	Native support for hypervisors (eg, Xen, PAPR, KVM, ...)
 *	64 bit Inferno.
 *	Native port to the Nokia N800.
 *	Hosted port to Symbian OS.
 *	[Other Inferno projects |
	http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/wiki/Project_Suggestions].
 *	Web application development framework.
 *	New window manager to replace wm.
 *	New look for tk widgets.

[Plan 9 from User Space | http://plan9.us] or other work in foreign
systems:
 *	Add missing kencc extensions to GCC.
 *	Port [the Plan 9 compilers |
	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/compiler.html] to Linux or BSD.
 *	Glendix: Build a minimal Linux or BSD distribution using [Plan 9
	from User Space | http://plan9.us].
 *	Package [Plan 9 from User Space | http://plan9.us] and Inferno for
	your favorite Linux or BSD distribution.
 *	Mozilla/Firefox 9P Protocol Handler (i.e. 9P client XPCOM
	component).
