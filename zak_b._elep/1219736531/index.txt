I've been following Plan 9 since early 2007, but its only now (Aug
2008) that I've begun to set up a full Plan 9 network for daily use.
I'm starting with a CPU/file/auth server, `cloud9', and `pretzel', a
terminal.

I'll use this page to document my experience and set up of my Plan 9
network. And maybe later on, as an index for stuff I'll be writing
for and on Plan 9. ;-)
