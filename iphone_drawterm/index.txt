iPhone drawterm

Now that the iPhone SDK is out -- what about an iPhone version of
drawterm that exposes graphics, audio, etc. from the phone?

I'd put forth the idea of a hosted inferno port, but it strikes me
that would be significantly more work.

Perhaps the PlanB/Octopus crowd has better ideas of a iPhone-style
client.
