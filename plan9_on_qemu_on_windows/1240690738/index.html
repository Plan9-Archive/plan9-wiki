Quick
and
dirty
guide
for
running
plan
9
under
qemu
Virtual
Machine
in
windows
xp
(and
possibly
2000+):
<p class='para'>
Required
Skill:
Advanced:
Networking
experience
is
mandatory
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Please
read
through
and
be
sure
you
know
exactly
what
you're
doing.
Risks
to
software
content
and
possibly
hardware
are
plentiful
while
responsibility
are
hold
none.
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
01.
Download
"qemu-0.9.0-windows.zip",
"openvpn-2.0.9-install.exe"
and
"plan9.iso.bz2".
</p>

<p class='para'>
02.
Extract
"plan9.iso"
and
"qemu-0.9.0-windows"
to
the
same
directory.
</p>

<p class='para'>
03.
Install
"openvpn-2.0.9-install.exe".
</p>

<p class='para'>
04.
Rename
the
new
network
connection
(found
in
Network
Connections)
to
"TAP_OpenVPN".
</p>

<p class='para'>
05.
Bridge
"TAP_OpenVPN"
and
your
WAN/LAN
Connection
(usually
"Local
Area
Connection",
should
be
enabled
and
has
packet
changes
when
downloading)
-
This
is
done
by
choosing
both
connections
and
then
in
the
properties
menu
choosing
"Bridge".
</p>

<p class='para'>
06.
Notice
your
configurations
now
reside
in
the
new
"bridge
connection"
instead
of
"Local
Area
Connection".
</p>

<p class='para'>
07.
Use:
"qemu.exe
-L
-m
128
-cdrom
..\plan9.iso
-boot
d
-net
nic,model=rtl8139
-net
tap,ifname=TAP_OpenVPN
-soundhw
sb16
-localtime"
to
start
plan9,
this
command
can
be
inserted
into
a
batch
file.
</p>

<p class='para'>
08.
In
the
VM
(referred
to
as
"guest
machine")
:
In
the
boot
options
choose
to
boot
from
the
CD
or
See
<a href="../../installing_plan_9_on_qemu">installing
plan
9
on
qemu</a>.
</p>

<p class='para'>

Guest:
You
can
press
"return/enter"
for
the
rest
of
the
questions
presented
by
in
the
boot
sequence
-
default
will
suffice.
</p>

<p class='para'>
10.
Done.
Please
read
through
the
notes...
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Ctrl+Alt
to
release
the
mouse
from
the
qemu
window
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Set
up
networking
using
DHCP
(good
with
the
bridge
explained
above
and
if
router
supplies
IPs
(dhcp)):
"ip/ipconfig"
"ndb/dns
-r"
"ip/ping
address"
test
by
pinging
your
gateway/router
using
its
ip
address,
then
try
a
site
like
www.google.com
which
you
know
will
return
icmp
(respond
to
ping).
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
When
using
acme
in
qemu
with
live
boot
iso,
notice
that
file
creation
is
only
possible
in
/tmp,
not
even
in
the
/usr/glenda
(the
user
that
you
log
in
as)
-
this
will
be
resolved
if
you
install
to
hard
drive.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Installing
to
HardDisk:
use
"qemu-img.exe
create
plan9hd.img
1024M"
to
set
a
1gig
Virtual
HardDisk,
use
"qemu.exe
-L
.
-m
128
-hda
plan9hd.img
-cdrom
..\plan9.iso
-boot
d
-net
nic,model=rtl8139
-net
tap,ifname=TAP_OpenVPN
-localtime"
to
boot.
You
can
install
to
HD
or
mount
the
drive
and
format
it
to
use
as
you
wish,
plan9
tends
to
have
a
very
slow
install
process
in
VM.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
If
you
don't
actually
know
how
to
use
plan9,
http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/
has
some
good
info,
http://plan9.escet.urjc.es/who/nemo/9.intro.pdf
will
do
even
better.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
qemu
will
emulate
sb16
which
is
supported
by
plan9;
however,
I
was
unable
to
verify
its
functionality.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Common
Issue:
the
pc
halts
in
different
parts
of
the
network
configuration
process:
This
is
due
to
other
VM
virtual
nics
conflicting
with
the
each
other.
Solutions
vary
from
disabling
to
deleting
the
other
VM's
nics.
In
the
worst
case
plan
9
can
run
without
networking,
though
to
what
use
?
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Common
Issue:
High
CPU
Usage:
this
is
not
a
problem
but
the
result
of
the
qemu
normal
functionality.
If
a
process
on
the
host
machine
requires
more
CPU
time,
qemu
will
reduce
the
load
itself
-
this
can
be
forced
by
reducing
the
process
priority
using
the
task
manager.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Common
Issue:
"TAP_OpenVPN"
always
appears
to
be
disconnected:
this
is
a
false
readout,
ignore
it
as
it
has
no
ill
effects.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Common
Issue:
9P
connectivity
seems
to
be
broken:
firewall,
router
firewall...
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Play
around
with
the
res:
800x600x8
and
above
seems
to
be
more
useful
for
working
with
acme...
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
For
sound
see
the
qemu
readme,
I
never
succeeded
though
it
might
have
been
for
lack
of
trying...
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Less
questions
at
boot:
Download
plan9.flp
and
replace
plan9.ini
that
with
the
following
(use
winimage
or
mount
through
loopback
device):
</li>
</ul>

this
will
reduce
the
questions
to
one
"press

the

<p class='para'>
This

is
unnecessary
in

ToDo:

<p class='para'>
1.
Sound.

<p class='para'>
2.
Boot
with
no
q&amp;a:
When
not
installing
but
rather
using
the
live
boot,
you
are
presented
whenever
you
start
the
machine
with
a
series
of
questions
(monitor,
res,
mouse),
I
managed
to
set
plan9.ini
in
the
floppy
image
so
that
only
one
question
will
be
presented,
but
that
is
still
one
question
too
much.
