#Drawterm(8) is not a Plan 9 program. It is a program that users of
#non-Plan 9 systems can use to establish graphical cpu(1) connections
#with Plan 9 CPU servers. Just as a real Plan 9 terminal does,
#drawterm serves its local name space as well as some devices (the
#keyboard, mouse, and screen) to a remote CPU server, which mounts
#this name space on /mnt/term and starts a shell. Typically, either
#explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell to start rio(1).

#NOTES
#
#When drawterm-linux starts you might well see an error message like
#this : cpu: failed to chdir to $dir where $dir is, in fact, pwd on
#your linux box. I haven't looked very far to find out where that
#happens because I added fn drawterm {@{cd /; drawterm-linux $* }} to
#$home/.rcrc and cd to the top of lib/profile to put me in $home on
#startup.
#
#To access a Plan 9 cpu(1) server behind a packet filter, you need to
#allow access to the following ports: 17010, 17013 and 567 (to the
#auth(8) server).
