Drawterm(8) is not a Plan 9 program. It is a program that users of
non-Plan 9 systems can use to establish graphical cpu(1) connections
with Plan 9 CPU servers. Just as a real Plan 9 terminal does,
drawterm serves its local name space as well as some devices (the
keyboard, mouse, and screen) to a remote CPU server, which mounts
this name space on /mnt/term and starts a shell. Typically, either
explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell to start rio(1).

DOWNLOAD

To get the latest source for drawterm from a system with Mercurial:

! $ hg clone http://code.swtch.com/drawterm

In the Plan 9 distribution: [/sys/src/cmd/unix/drawterm/ |
http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/plan9/sys/src/cmd/unix/drawterm/]
(sometimes out of date)

For more information and binaries for various systems see:
[http://swtch.com/drawterm/]

NOTES

When drawterm-linux starts you might well see an error message like
this : cpu: failed to chdir to $dir where $dir is, in fact, pwd on
your linux box. I haven't looked very far to find out where that
happens because I added fn drawterm {@{cd /; drawterm-linux $* }} to
$home/.rcrc and cd to the top of lib/profile to put me in $home on
startup.

To access a Plan 9 cpu(1) server behind a packet filter, you need to
allow access to the following ports: 17010, 17013 and 567 (to the
auth(8) server).
