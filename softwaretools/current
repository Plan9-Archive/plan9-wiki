#This page is an attempt to begin a systematic exposition of Plan 9's
#philosophy to make Plan 9 accessible to users not accustomed to the
#Bell Labs/original Unix way of thinking. There are plenty of people
#more knowledgable than I am, so please pardon and correct any
#inaccuracies. -- npe

#Just started, don't expect much. Feel free to add anything, this is
#meant to be a collaborative effort.
