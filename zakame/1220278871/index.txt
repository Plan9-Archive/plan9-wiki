I've been following Plan 9 since early 2007, but its only now (Aug
2008) that I've begun to set up a full Plan 9 network for daily use.

I'll use this page to document my experience and set up of my Plan 9
network. And maybe later on, as an index for stuff I'll be writing
for and on Plan 9. ;-)

DEMO SETUP: PLAN 9 ON PARALLELS DESKTOP

I've successfully set up a Plan 9 network on Parallels Desktop 3.0
(build 5608). It consists of 3 virtual machines:

 *	'cloud9': CPU/auth server, initially with hard disks, later moved
	to file server
 *	'pretzel': fossil(4) file server with venti(8) storage
 *	'knots': diskless terminal

Installation began on cloud9 as a standalone terminal, on a
fossil(4)-only disk. After installation from CD, I logged in as _adm_
to install the Philippines timezone:

! 	% cat >/adm/timezone/Philippines
! 	PHT 28800 PHT 28800
! 	% cp /adm/timezone/Philippines /adm/timezone/local

Once enabling the local timezone, I added my own user, and added
another disk for the venti(8) archival store.
