Dual booting bare machine and vmware <i>-Diff-</i></h1>

</div><hr />I
run
my
Plan
9
terminal
off
of
a
second
hard
drive.
The
primary
drive
holds
my
linux
partitions.
Much
of
the
time
I
run
Plan
9
from
a
vmware
virtual
machine,
but
have
occasion
to
boot
straight
to
Plan
9
occasionally.
My
linux
boot
loader
(grub)
allows
me
to
boot
Plan
9
from
a
menu
selection,
but
usually
defaults
to
linux.
<p class='para'>
I
started
by
booting
my
virtual
machine
the
obvious
way
-
expose
both
drives
to
the
VM,
and
select
to
boot
Plan
9.
Trouble
comes
up
when
I
miss
the
time-out
though:
it
tries
to
boot
linux
again
from
the
same
disk
it's
already
running
on
-
a
risky
proposition
at
the
best
of
times.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
next
fix
to
try
was
to
use
the
secondary
drive
as
the
primary
drive
of
the
VM,
but
this
falls
apart
because
fossil
encodes
the
partition
identifier
on
the
file
system
itself.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
simple
solution
(thanks
to
Takeshi
Yamanashi)
was
to
build
a
small
virtual
hard
drive
in
VMWare,
and
to
pre-load
it
with
a
master
boot
record
and
9fat
file
system;
I
have
to
remember
to
update
kernels
in
two
places
(there
and
on
my
secondary
drive
for
cold-
bootin)
but
it
works
like
a
charm.
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
make
such
a
file
system,
use
VMWare
to
add
a
new
(small!
0.1Gig
is
plenty!)
disk
to
a
Plan
9
virtual
machine
that
already
boots.
Boot
your
vm,
and
check
what
the
new
drive
is
called:
</p>

<pre>
prompt% ls -d /dev/sd??
/dev/sdC0
/dev/sdC1
/dev/sdD0
</pre>

<p class='para'>
In
my
case
the
new
drive
was
/dev/sdC1
-
corresponding
to
ide0:1
in
my
vmware
machine.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
you
have
to
give
that
partition
a
master
boot
record,
fdisk
it,
prep
it,
and
format
it.
Before
going
any
further,
mount
your
dos
partition:
</p>

<pre>
prompt% 9fat:
</pre>

<p class='para'>
or
else
you'll
have
to
go
digging
for
9load,
a
kernel,
and
your
plan9.ini
if
you
wait
until
you've
built
the
9fat
we're
going
to
put
together
(you
can
mount
the
9fat
drive
later,
but
the
9fat:
script
fails
when
there
is
more
than
one
9fat
partition
available)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
we
can
start
prepping
the
new
virtual
partition:
</p>

<a name="WARNING:" /><h3>WARNING:</h3>

<p class='para'>
If
you
hit
the
wrong
partition
with
these
commands
you
*will*
do
damage
to
your
system.
In
my
example
I'm
using
sdC1
-
that
might
not
be
yours!
</p>

<p class='para'>
So
to
start
we
give
the
new
disk
an
MBR:
</p>

<pre>
prompt% disk/mbr -m /386/pbs /dev/sdC1/data
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Then
we
fdisk
it,
making
one
large
plan9
partition:
</p>

<pre>
prompt% disk/fdisk -baw /dev/sdC1/data
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Next
we
prep
it
to
make
a
9fat
sub-partition:
</p>

<pre>
prompt% disk/prep -bw -a9fat /dev/sdC1/plan9
</pre>

<p class='para'>
And
finally
we
format
the
new
partition,
telling
format
to
add
the
9load,
kernel,
and
plan9.ini
files.
I
used
the
files
from
my
working
boot
partition;
the
order
you
specify
these
in
matters
-
9load
has
to
be
first.
See
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/prep"><i>prep</i>(8)</a>
for
the
other
options:
</p>

<pre>
prompt% disk/format -b /386/pbs -d -r 2 /dev/sdC1/9fat /n/9fat/9load /n/9fat/9pcf /n/9fat/plan9.ini
</pre>

<p class='para'>
You
can,
of
course,
use
whatever
kernel
you
want
-
9pcf
just
happens
to
come
with
the
distribution.
You
can
also
add
more
files
to
the
list
(including
more
kernels),
although
once
the
new
9fat
fs
is
built,
you
can
just
mount
it
and
copy
more
files
there.
</p>

<p class='para'>
I
hope
this
works
for
you
as
well
as
it
did
for
me.
