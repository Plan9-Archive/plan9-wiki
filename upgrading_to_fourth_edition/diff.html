If
you
have
an
extant
third
edition
Plan
9
system,
you
are
strongly
encouraged
to
make
a
boot
floppy
for
it
before
proceeding
with
this
installation.
To
make
a
third
edition
boot
floppy,
boot
your
third
edition
system
and
run
the
commands:
<pre>
	9fat:
	disk/format -b /386/pbs -df /dev/fd0disk \
		/n/9fat/9load /n/9fat/plan9.ini /386/9pcdisk.gz
	a:
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Then
edit
/n/a:/plan9.ini
to
change
the
bootfile=
line
to
``bootfile=fd0!9pcdisk.gz''.
Make
sure
the
floppy
boots.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You
should
read
Forsyth's
guide
below,
but
I'd
suggest
you
also
read
the
final
Nemo's
comments
before
starting.

At
several
points
in
the
following
description
I'll
suggest
one
way
but
note
that
I
did
things
differently.
That's
typically
because
I
think
I
could
have
saved
myself
a
little
time
and
effort
if
I
had
done
what
I
now
suggest
(had
I
known
or
thought
of
it).
I
tell
you
what
I
did
differently
just
in
case
the
alternative
has
its
own
pitfalls,
since
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
test
it.
In
any
case,
you
do
need
to
think
carefully
whether
what
I
suggest
makes
sense,
since
I
could
easily
have
missed
a
step
out.
I
really
needed
a
reality
recorder
to
double
check
but
they
were
none
left
at
the
hire
centre
down
the
road.
</p>

<p class='para'>
These
instructions
(`rough
guide'
or
`hints'
might
be
more
accurate)
are
intended
to
aid
those
trying
to
upgrade
from
3rd
Edition
to
4th
Edition
on
a
Plan
9
network
with
a
file
server,
a
cpu
server
and
a
terminal,
especially
where
the
cpu
server
takes
its
root
from
the
file
server,
and
acts
as
authentication
server
to
the
network.
My
file
server
is
called
`dispensa'
and
I'll
use
that
in
examples.
</p>

<p class='para'>
For
the
upgrade
it
is
probably
essential
to
have
a
safe
place
to
work:
thus
you'll
need
a
machine
running
4th
Edition
off
a
kfs
file
system
independently
from
the
existing
3rd
Edition
network.
It
must
contain
all
the
source.
Make
sure
that
machine
seems
in
good
shape
before
proceeding,
and
that
it
really
does
work
standalone,
although
you
should
also
ensure
that
it
has
copies
of
your
network
/lib/ndb/local
file
and
others.
For
instance,
check
port
assignments
in
/lib/ndb/common.
I
needed
to
add:
</p>

<pre>
tcp=wiki port=17035 
</pre>

<p class='para'>
to
the
new
distribution.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Fetch
the
plan9.iso.bz2
distribution
onto
the
bootstrap
machine.
I
stored
it
and
also
unpacked
it
on
my
Windows
partition,
as
/n/c/tmp/plan9.iso.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
installation
process
below
does
not
use
the
special
Plan
9
installation
diskette;
it
uses
a
kfs-based
Plan
9
system
running
rio
and
other
things
after
you
have
logged
in
the
usual
way.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Back
up
file
server
content
you
care
about.
(I
didn't
do
that
myself:
I've
got
a
replica
of
anything
important.)
Make
sure
you've
got
at
least
350
Mbytes
free
on
the
target
file
server.
If
you've
got
a
pseudo-worm
or
worm,
check
the
`statw'
result
to
ensure
you've
got
enough
space
left
before
wmax
both
before
and
after
installation,
and
make
sure
the
cache
is
at
least
600-800
Mbytes
or
more.
(The
installation
is
effectively
into
the
cache
so
it
needs
to
be
big
enough,
and
it's
organised
into
hash
buckets
and
you
need
enough
slop
to
reduce
the
chances
of
any
one
of
them
overflowing.)
If
you've
installed
3rd
Edition
into
the
same
configuration
you
should
be
all
right.
Do
a
`dump'
first
if
needed
to
flush
anything
important
out
of
the
cache.
</p>

<p class='para'>
(I
think
I
ended
up
installing
only
280
to
300
Mbytes.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
1.
File
server
</p>

<p class='para'>
Build
a
4th
Edition
file
server
kernel
for
your
hardware
configuration,
on
your
4th
Edition
kfs-based
machine.
</p>

<p class='para'>
It's
fairly
simple
if
you've
got
an
existing
3rd
Edition
kernel,
but
be
sure
to
read
/sys/src/fs/words
because
important
details
have
changed.
For
instance,
plan9pc
isn't
there,
but
it
isn't
needed
because
the
source
file
structure
has
changed
(probably
not
perfect
but
much
improved
from
last
time).
`emelie'
is
there
but
is
used
at
most
as
a
static
prototype
(you'll
typically
want
to
use
a
few
files
from
your
3rd
edition
directory).
In
particular,
the
peculiar
requirement
has
gone
that
mem.h
and
other
files
needed
to
be
the
same
in
two
directories
because
the
source
files
in
each
directory
used
their
own
mem.h.
If
that
worries
you
be
grateful
it
has
gone.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Set
up
and
compile
the
thing
taking
into
account
the
content
of
/sys/src/fs/words.
Now
boot
it
up,
and
see
that
it
checks
properly,
serves
the
existing
3rd
Edition
network,
and
otherwise
seems
all
right.
It
uses
the
existing
stored
file
system
config
block
and
interacts
correctly
with
both
3rd
Edition
clients.
If
you
make
a
new
diskette
to
hold
it
be
sure
to
copy
the
existing
plan.nvr.
(I
instead
copied
it
in
to
the
existing
diskette
as
9pcfs4.gz
and
changed
plan9.ini
accordingly).
You
can
also
check
that
you
can
9fs
to
it
from
your
4th
Edition
machine.
(I
think
you
should
see
factotum's
prompt
at
some
point.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
I
did
not
do
this
next
bit
but
I
think
it
would
have
helped
if
I
had.
I'll
get
to
try
it
when
I
update
system
at
work,
but
that's
not
for
a
litle
while
yet.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Change
the
file
server
code
(whooo!)
as
follows.
Save
the
original
/sys/src/fs/con.c
so
you
can
restore
it
later
(or
it
will
complicate
updates
slightly).
Find
the
line:
</p>

<pre>
// authdisableflag =flag_install("authdisable", "-- disable authentication");
</pre>

<p class='para'>
and
uncomment
it.
Rebuild
your
file
server
kernel.
Reboot
with
it.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
system
as
distributed
(``correct
me
if
I'm
wrong'')
has
no
way
to
suppress
4th
Edition
authentication.
The
undocumented
`noauth'
configuration
console
command
does
not
affect
the
9P2000
side
of
things.
I
was
lucky
because
I
had
already
attached
to
my
file
server
from
the
4th
Edition
bootstrap
machine
using
the
existing
3rd
Edition
cpu/auth
server
to
authenticate
the
connection,
but
I
had
to
be
extremely
careful
thereafter
not
to
lose
that
window--not
to
mention
keeping
the
bootstrap
machine
on
and
the
file
server
up--once
the
cpu
server
had
been
shut
down
and
the
file
system
update
was
underway.
Had
I
realised
in
time,
I'd
have
made
the
above
change,
and
just
in
case
that
wasn't
enough,
I'd
have
opened
a
few
more
windows
with
the
file
server
mounted.
</p>

<p class='para'>
2.
Shuffle
the
file
server
contents.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You
have
several
choices
here.
You
can
build
a
completely
new
file
server,
add
a
new
file
system
to
the
existing
file
server
and
install
to
that
temporarily
(then
make
it
`main'
later),
move
things
out
of
the
way
in
the
existing
file
server,
or
scrap
the
lot.
I
opted
to
move
things
out
of
the
way.
That
way
they'd
be
nearby
when
copying
site-specific
changes
into
the
new
structure.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You'll
need
access
to
the
file
server
console,
nearby.
(I
set
mine
for
serial
console,
plugged
into
the
back
of
my
bootstrap
machine;
that's
convenient,
but
can
be
a
bit
worrying
during
the
initial
boot
phase
when
the
BIOS
probes
devices
but
nothing
appears.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Boot
the
file
server,
hit
a
key
within
5
seconds
to
enter
config
mode,
and
type
`allow'
to
stop
permission
checking,
`noauth'
in
case
it
makes
any
difference,
then
`end'
to
start
up
the
file
server.
At
the
normal
command
prompt
type
flag
authdisable
to
disable
authentication
checking.
</p>

<p class='para'>
With
the
new
file
server
running,
attach
to
it
on
the
bootstrap
machine
using
9fs.
I'd
do
that
in
at
least
two
windows
so
you
can
keep
an
eye
on
progress
in
one
whilst
installing
in
the
other.
(I
thought
I'd
slipped
up
here
by
using
9fs
and
getting
a
mount
without
-c,
which
caused
me
trouble
later,
but
I've
just
checked
that
9fs
does
use
mount
-c.)
If
even
the
flag
authdisable
doesn't
allow
mounts
to
work
(you
get
an
authentication
error,
you
can
start
up
your
cpu/auth
server,
connect,
and
then
shut
down
the
cpu
server
again).
</p>

<p class='para'>
My
file
server
has
got
a
(pseudo-)worm,
so
all
the
3rd
Edition
binaries
and
source
were
in
the
dump,
and
all
I
needed
to
preserve
immediately
were
mailboxes,
/adm
files,
some
/lib/ndb
files,
and
the
usual
odds
and
ends
I
can't
remember
to
list.
Because
it's
in
the
worm,
there's
no
space
freed
up
by
removing
the
3rd
Edition
content,
so
I
simply
moved
it
all
aside
during
installation,
using
something
like
this:
</p>

<pre>
for(a in list-of-all-files-but-adm-and-usr){mv $a 3e_$a}
</pre>

<p class='para'>
leaving
3e_sys
3e_lib,
etc.
That
way
there
was
also
half
a
chance
I
could
mv
it
back
if
it
went
wrong.
</p>

<pre>
rm -r usr/glenda NOTICE LICENSE
</pre>

<p class='para'>
because
I
wanted
the
update
to
include
the
new
usr/glenda
(for
reference)
and
knew
it
would
moan
if
I'd
already
got
one.
You
could
{mv
usr/glenda
usr/3e_glenda}
I
suppose.
I
made
a
mkfs
archive
copy
of
adm
to
save
the
bootstrap
machine,
just
in
case,
but
left
it
in
place
(wanting
my
existing
users
and
keys,
and
relying
on
the
update
process
not
overwriting
existing
files).
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
result
is
a
root
containing
several
3e_*
directories,
and
my
existing
`adm'
and
`usr'
directories.
(Note
that
I
mv'd
mail
to
3e_mail,
but
later
I
mv'd
it
back
after
the
update
installed
its
version,
mv'ing
that
to
4e_mail
to
allow
me
to
compare
/mail/lib
contents.)

the
pot
of
tea
was
still
useful.

<p class='para'>
4th
Edition
now
occupies
the
file
server.
Although
I
did
not
do
so
this
time,
if
you
have
a
pseudo-worm,
you
might
decide
to
do
a
`dump'
at
this
point
to
snapshot
the
unmodified
4th
Edition
content,
in
case
you
slip
up
when
editing.
Since
I
could
always
retrieve
things
from
plan9.iso
or
the
bootstrap
system,
I
did
not
bother.
</p>

<p class='para'>
6.
Configuration
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
rather
tedious
business
of
copying
local
configuration
changes
across
begins.
The
main
ones
to
watch
are
/lib/ndb/local,
/lib/ndb/auth,
/rc/bin/termrc
and
/rc/bin/cpurc,
and
of
course
/lib/sky/here.
The
details
are
site-dependent,
and
if
you
are
upgrading,
you've
presumably
done
it
once,
so
I
have
no
real
advice
to
offer
here.
(Note
that
aux/timesync
in
the
prototype
has
the
L
option
to
coexist
with
Windows'
idea
of
time;
you
might
remove
that
as
I
do.)
In
the
prototype
cpurc,
note
that
ndb/dns
is
started
-r
but
you
might
use
-s,
and
the
timesync
server,
as
the
comment
requests,
should
NOT
be
plan9.bell-labs.com
.
The
prototype
also
includes
-t
/rc/bin/service.auth
as
parameters
to
aux/listen.
I
replace
those
lines
with
a
case
statement
distinguishes
my
cpu/auth
server
from
any
other
general-
or
special-purpose
cpu
servers
(eg,
gateways),
and
set
cpurc
to
do
appropriate
things
in
each
arm.
For
a
cpu/auth/dhcp
server
I
use:
</p>

<pre>
switch($sysname){ 
case lavoro 
	ip/dhcpd 
	ip/tftpd
	ip/httpd/httpd -d $facedom
	auth/keyfs -m /mnt/keys /adm/keys
	auth/cron
	aux/listen -q -d /rc/bin/service -t /rc/bin/service.auth il
	aux/listen -q -d /rc/bin/service -t /rc/bin/service.auth tcp
</pre>

<p class='para'>
(The
prototype
has
a
different
invocation
of
auth/cron.)
For
everything
else
I
use:
</p>

<pre>
case * 
	aux/listen -q il
	aux/listen -q tcp 
}
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Next,
sort
out
/rc/bin/service
and
/rc/bin/service.auth.
</p>

<p class='para'>
For
a
cpu
server
that
is
also
an
authentication
server:
</p>

<pre>
cp /rc/bin/service.auth/authsrv.il566 /rc/bin/service.auth/il566 
cp /rc/bin/service.auth/authsrv.tcp567 /rc/bin/service.auth/tcp567 
mv /rc/bin/service/il566 /rc/bin/service/_il566 
mv /rc/bin/service/tcp567 /rc/bin/service/_tcp567 
</pre>

<p class='para'>
You'll
probably
find
the
last
two
aren't
there
anyway.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Several
files
seem
to
be
missing
to
allow
the
new
cpu
service
to
run
(it's
ncpu=17010).
I
installed
these
based
on
other
files
and
the
old
edition:
</p>

<pre>
/rc/bin/service/il17010 
#!/bin/cpu -R
/rc/bin/service/tcp17010 
#!/bin/cpu -R 
</pre>

<p class='para'>
make
them
executable.
</p>

<p class='para'>
ncpunote
is
reserved
in
/lib/ndb/common
but
I'm
not
sure
whether
there's
actually
a
service
behind
it.
</p>

<p class='para'>
I
also
added
these
two:
</p>

<pre>
cp /bin/service/_il17007 /bin/service/il17007

/rc/bin/service/il17009 
#!/bin/rc 
exec /bin/ip/rexexec 
</pre>

<p class='para'>
but
you
might
decide
otherwise.
</p>

<p class='para'>
7.
Factotum
</p>

<p class='para'>
/sys/src/9/boot,
in
the
built-in
root
of
a
kernel
as
/boot,
expects
factotum
to
help
authenticate
for
it
if
it's
going
for
a
root
from
a
file
server,
but
factotum
expects
an
authentication
server
to
be
running
to
make
tickets
for
it.
This
poses
a
problem
if
your
cpu/auth
server
takes
its
root
over
the
network
from
your
file
server.
</p>

<p class='para'>
I
copied
the
factotum
source
and
changed
it
to
make
a
ticket
for
a
server,
which
it
can
do
since
it
has
a
copy
of
the
server's
key
kept
in
notional
NVRAM
(typically
a
file
on
a
diskette,
but
it
can
prompt
if
that's
not
available).
My
change
does
that
only
if
the
attempt
to
use
an
authentication
server
fails.
(There
was
already
some
commented-out
code
near
that
point
referring
to
a
nonexistent
function
mktickets.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
my
copy
of
/sys/src/cmd/auth/factotum
I
changed
p9sk1.c's
gettickets
to
call
a
new
function:
</p>

<pre>
   static int
   mkserverticket(State *s, char *tbuf)
   {
       Ticketreq *tr = &amp;s-&gt;tr;
       Ticket t;

       if(strcmp(tr-&gt;authid, tr-&gt;hostid) != 0 || strcmp(tr-&gt;authid, tr-&gt;uid) != 0)
           return -1;
       memset(&amp;t, 0, sizeof(t));
       memmove(t.chal, tr-&gt;chal, CHALLEN);
       strcpy(t.cuid, tr-&gt;uid);
       strcpy(t.suid, tr-&gt;uid);
       memrandom(t.key, DESKEYLEN);
       t.num = AuthTc;
       convT2M(&amp;t, tbuf, s-&gt;key-&gt;priv);
       t.num = AuthTs;
       convT2M(&amp;t, tbuf+TICKETLEN, s-&gt;key-&gt;priv);
       return 0;
   }

   static int
   gettickets(State *s, char *trbuf, char *tbuf)
   {
   /*
       if(mktickets(s, trbuf, tbuf) &gt;= 0)
           return 0;
   */
       if(getastickets(s, trbuf, tbuf) &gt;= 0)
           return 0;
       if(sflag)
           return mkserverticket(s, tbuf);
       return -1;
   }
</pre>
8.
Configure
and
build
new
cpu
kernel
<p class='para'>
Once
again,
you
need
to
change
/sys/src/9/pccpu
(or
a
copy)
to
suit
your
existing
cpu
server
configuration.
Before
building
it,
I
bound
my
modified
factotum
over
/386/bin/factotum
so
that
modified
version
would
be
put
in
the
root
of
the
cpu/auth
server
kernel.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Copy
it
onto
a
boot
diskette.
(I
simply
overwrote
the
9pccpu.gz
file
on
my
existing
boot
diskette.
No
going
back
for
me.)
Before
booting
it,
type
flag
authdisable
on
the
file
server
console
to
toggle
the
flag
to
ensure
that
you
test
authentication.
flag
attach
is
useful
to
see
the
effect.
Now
try
booting
the
cpu/auth
server.
It
should
authenticate,
connect,
and
boot
up.
Watch
for
errors
from
running
cpurc.
</p>

<p class='para'>
9.
Terminal
</p>

<p class='para'>
Build
a
4th
Edition
terminal
kernel
and
boot
it
up
on
another
machine,
if
you've
got
one.
I
had
nothing
spare
at
the
time
and
I
was
confident
enough
to
use
my
bootstrap
machine,
rebooting
it
in
its
usual
mode
as
a
terminal.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Then
I
set
about
removing
obsolete
3e_
files
and
directories,
still
in
`allow'
mode
to
bypass
permissions
checking,
before
shutting
everything
down
and
rebooting
in
`normal'
file
server
mode.
</p>

<p class='para'>
10.
Run
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
is
the
time
to
start
changing
all
your
code
to
fit
in.
(I
went
to
bed.)
</p>

<a name="NEMO'S_COMMENTS" /><h3>NEMO'S COMMENTS</h3>

<p class='para'>
I
followed
most
of
forsyth's
instructions,
but
did
several
steps
in
a
different
way,
which
I
think
is
simpler.
What
I
did
is
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Setup
a
standalone
4th
edition
cpu
server.
Remember
to
follow
forsyth's
advice
regarding
authentication.
</li>

<li>
Compile
a
4th
edition
file
server
</li>

<li>
Boot
the
3rd
edition
file
server
with
the
4th
edition
kernel
(Remember
to
issue
the
commands
to
disable
auth,
as
said
in
forsyth's
guide).
</li>

<li>
Update
the
4th
edition
cpu
server's
kfs
with
config
from
the
file
server
(ndbs,
services,
cpurc,
termrc,
mail,
etc.)
</li>

<li>
Boot
a
4th
edition
terminal
to
test
mail
and
other
services
as
provided
by
the
standalone
4th
edition
cpu
server.
</li>

<li>
Move
file
server
files
/x
to
/x_3e
(see
forsyth's
guide).
</li>

<li>
Use
disk/mkfs
and
disk/mkext
to
copy
the
entire
kfs
file
system
from
the
cpu
server
to
the
real
file
server.
</li>

<li>
Reboot
a
diskless
terminal,
see
that
it
works
</li>

<li>
Reboot
the
cpu
server,
diskless
this
time.
</li>

<li>
Once
I'm
happy,
reboot
all
machines
to
enable
permission
checking
on
the
file
server.
</li>

<li>
All
set.
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
good
thing
of
doing
it
this
way
is
that
I
didn't
have
to
fully
understand
the
replica
thing
to
get
the
machines
upgraded.
Now
that
I
have
a
full
4th
ed
network,
I
can
take
time
to
learn.
