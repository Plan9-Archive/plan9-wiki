#The Raspberry Pi contains a lot of interesting bits that we aren't
#yet doing anything with. Here's a (more or less complete) list of
#things we'd like to see done, with some info on each.

#The best starting point for an [overview of the Pi's hardware

#These are display and camera interfaces, located at S2 and S5 on the
#Pi, respectively. These are not widely supported on the various
#systems which run on the Pi, and compatible hardware is not very
#common. Compatible displays can be found in some smartphones.
