</div><hr />Cross
domain
authentication
has
been
implemented
in
two
different
forms
recently
(Jul
2005),
however
there
is
still
discussion
about
the
"best"
solution.

<p class='para'>
(Taken
from
a
post
by
David
Presotto
to
the
9grid
list:
<a href="http://nwn.definitive.org/pipermail/9grid/2004-September/000269.html">http://nwn.definitive.org/pipermail/9grid/2004-September/000269.html</a>)
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
the
current
scheme,
when
a
user
authenticates,
he/she
gets
a
list
of
domains
that
the
server
will
accept
and
picks
one
to
use
(i.e.
one
he
has
a
key
for).
That
should
provide
the
second
part
of
the
name,
i.e.,
if
I'm
presotto
authenticating
via
the
domain
bignose.com
then
I
should
be
presotto@bignose.com.
Tacking
on
the
@bignose.com
is
currently
missing.
</p>

<p class='para'>
That
of
course
leaves
the
server
to
map
the
domain
bignose.com
to
an
auth
server
that
it
trusts
(i.e.
has
a
key
for
and
trusts
others
to
authenticate
via).
Currently
that's
done
via
the
lib/ndb
entry
</p>

<pre>
	authdom=bignose.com auth=1.2.3.4
</pre>

<p class='para'>
So
we
have
a
way
to
trust
other
authentication
domains
but
not
yet
a
way
to
tag
the
resulting
name.
However,
that's
like
1
line
of
code
in
factotum.
</p>

<p class='para'>
However,
this
requires
that
there
be
a
shared
key
twixt
each
server
and
each
domain
that
it
trusts.
I'll
leave
it
up
to
you
if
that's
too
much.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
the
server
is
a
cpu
server,
then
the
caller
can
export
its
factotum
to
its
process
on
that
cpu
server
so
that
it
can
authenticate
further.
Is
this
a
good
idea?
Would
we
be
letting
too
much
access
to
the
factotum?
Might
we
want
the
user
to
start
a
second
less
capable
factotum
for
9net
access?
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
client
coming
into
the
cpu
server
will
need
at
least
readonly
access
to
binaries
and
to
enough
directory
structure
to
set
up
a
name
space
on
that
machine.
I
already
had
to
make
that
work
for
the
deep
lens
survey
stuff.
I
made
ken's
group
'noworld'
access
work
for
that.
If
we
put
each
9net
user
in
the
'noworld'
group,
then
we
can
point
him
to
a
file
server
and
he
can
only
get
at
files
that
are
accessible
by
his
uid
or
by
the
'noworld'
group.
You
could
even
give
him
some
write
access
if
you
wanted
to.
It
keeps
such
users
from
accessing
anything
that
was
accidentally
made
world
readable
or
writable.
It
does
mean
that
you
have
to
change
the
file
server
so
that
anyone
coming
in
as
a@b
is
just
treated
as
a
'noworld'
group
user.
