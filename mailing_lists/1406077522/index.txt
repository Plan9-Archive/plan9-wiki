Mailing Lists


9FANS

9fans is a list for discussion about Plan 9 and related technologies.

To subscribe you can send an email to [9fans-request@9fans.net] with
"subscribe 9fans" as the body or use the web form at:
[http://mail.9fans.net/listinfo/9fans]

An unidirectional gateway forwards all 9fans emails to the Usenet
group [comp.os.plan9 |
http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9]; this used to be a
bidirectional gateway, but seems to be broken, so please only post to
9fans directly and not to comp.os.plan9.

Please avoid sending messages containing MIME or HTML.

9fans is archived in various places:

 *	[http://9fans.net/archive/] - Complete archives.

9TROUBLE

You can also email [9trouble@plan9.bell-labs.com |
mailto:9trouble@plan9.bell-labs.com] for support or report bugs. But
probably using 9fans is a better idea as the persons taking care of
9trouble are usually very busy.

	offline, we are trying to bring them back one way or another)
