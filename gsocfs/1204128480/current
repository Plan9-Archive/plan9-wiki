#OVERVIEW
#
#The general idea is that it would be nice to have a Plan 9/Inferno
#native mechanism to help use track google summer of code activities
#before, during, and after the summer. The main motivation for this
#was some of the crazy stuff that went on last year using the google
#voting interface, it would give us more control over preventing such
#things. So, the general idea is to have a synthetic file server
#which exports both file system and web-appropriate hierarchies which
#facilitate summer-of-code activities. The idea being that you could
#interact with them as easily under ACME as under a web-browser. This
#is really an instantiation of what I've been calling
#service-oriented-file-systems.
#
#POTENTIAL MILESTONES
#
# *	synethtic file system and web interface
# *	posting project ideas
# *	voting for projects
# *	registering student interest in projects
# *	project milestone tracking
# *	project blogs and wikis
# *	post-summer project success metrics (subjective and objective)
# *	(stretch) syndication points for community monitoring
# *	(stretch) potential integration with SCM
# *	(stretch) potential integration with some form of chat
# *	(stretch) potential integration with name space sharing
