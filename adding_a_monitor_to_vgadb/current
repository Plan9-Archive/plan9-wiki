Adding a monitor to vgadb

#If none of the monitors in /lib/vgadb fit your needs, you can create
#your own entry. Here, I'll go through the steps I used to make an
#entry for my Samsung SyncMaster 240T monitor. This assumes that you
#can boot Linux and get X running at a mode you like. I had mine
#running at 1920x1200 under X.
#
#Run xvidtune and collect the data it shows. Here's what I got:
#
#! Vendor: SAMSUNG, Model: SYNCMASTER 240T(DIGITAL)
#! Num hsync: 1, Num vsync: 1
#! hsync range 0:  29.00 -  81.00
#! vsync range 0:  39.00 -  85.00
#! HSyncStart: 2048 
#! HSyncEnd: 2256
#! HTotal: 2592
#! VSyncStart: 1201
#! VSyncEnd: 1204
#! VTotal: 1242
#! Pixel clock: 193.15 MHz
#! H-Sync: 74.52 kHz
#! V-Sync: 60.00 Hz
#
#Using these values and the comments in vgadb, I came up with the
#following entry:
#
#! sm240t=1920x1200
#! 	clock=193.15
#! 	shb=2048 ehb=2256 ht=2592
#! 	vrs=1201 vre=1204 vt=1242
#
#Look at those numbers. You'll see that "clock" corresponds to the
#"pixel clock" value from xvidtune; shb, ehb and ht correspond to
#HSyncStart, HSyncEnd, and HTotal, respectively; vrs, vre and vt to
#VSyncStart, VSyncEnd, and VTotal.
#
#Once I had this entry added to /lib/vgadb, all that remained was to
#edit plan9.ini to say "monitor=sm240t" and "vgasize=1920x1200x32".
#This method should be applicable to most monitors.
