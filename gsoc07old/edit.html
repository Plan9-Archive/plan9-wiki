Google Summer of Code 2007

STUDENTS

Plan 9 is an excellent environment to learn about many aspects of
computing: operating systems, distributed systems, programming
languages, network protocols, etc.

Plan 9 is not a difficult environment, and simplicity is its main
quality, but it is very *different* from anything else you might be
used to!

Fundamental requirements:

 *	A very open mind to explore and embrace very different concepts
	and environments.
 *	To enjoy challenges that stretch your preconceptions to the limit.

General recommended skills:

 *	Understanding of basic Unix principles and philosophy.
 *	Some programming experience, ideally with C but other languages
	are fine.

If you have any questions you can check our irc channel #plan9-gsoc
in irc.freenode.org or join the [Plan 9 Google Summer of Code |
http://groups.google.com/group/plan9-gsoc/] mailing list.

PROJECTS

Here is a list of projects we suggest, even if they seem complex and
difficult, they are probably much simpler than you think, in Plan 9
everything is simpler ;)

Please don't hesitate to check with us to discuss projects and feel
free to suggest any new project that is both exciting and innovative.

Misc and various projects:
 *	[Cross domain authentication]
 *	General purpose boot loader based on Plan 9 kernel and /dev/reboot
 *	Ssh2 client/server (complete native implementation or port a new
	one from another system)
 *	System for automatic detection/selection of screen resolution
 *	[Zeroconf | http://www.zeroconf.org] network configuration support
	(ideally, with a Plan 9 twist)

User space native Plan 9 applications:

 *	Bugfs: a bug tracking system with an fs interface
 *	Complete native dis (to run Inferno applications like native apps)
 *	CSS rendering for abaco web browser

Port of foreign applications:

 *	Video player (eg., port mplayer)
 *	Update GCC port and have it accepted upstream
 *	Do a port of the [Erlang | http://www.erlang.org] language
	(including appropriate parts of the library support).

Kernel related work:

 *	Write a driver for a piece of hardware of your choice
 *	OLPC port
 *	Finish Inferno port to the Nintendo DS

[9P | http://cat-v.org/9p/] related projects:

 *	fs driver for Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Windows, BeOS, or
	any other operating system (a Linux filesystem already exis)
 *	9P implementation in your favorite programming language.
 *	A framework to test the interoperativity of all existings 9P
	implementations.
 *	Implement 9P extension for 'batch requests'
 *	9P client implementation in JavaScript, so that a browser can
	access resources sensibly (ie, not using HTTP/XML).
 *	Firefox (and/or other browser plug-in) implementing 9P server(s)
	to make browser resources visible with 9P

[Plan 9 from User Space | http://plan9.us] or other work in foreign
systems:
 *	Add missing kencc extensions to GCC
 *	Port compilers to Linux or BSD

Please add any other project suggestions to the list, see also:[TODO].
