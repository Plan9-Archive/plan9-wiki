</div><hr />When
configuring
a
Plan
9
network,
the
first
machine
to
set
up
is
a
standalone
CPU
and
authentication
server.
After
you
have
this,
you
can
go
on
to
configure
a
file
server
and
then
boot
terminals
and
other
cpu
servers
from
it.
<p class='para'>
(Note
that
the
same
machine
can
act
as
both
auth/cpu
server
and
file
server.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Start
by
installing
the
distribution
as
though
creating
a
standalone
terminal.
Reboot
the
system,
and
log
in
as
any
user
that
is
in
group
sys.
To
add
a
user
to
group
sys
see
<a href="../adding_a_new_user">adding
a
new
user</a>.
The
user
needs
to
be
part
of
group
sys
in
order
to
be
able
to
edit
the
required
system
files.
In
the
default
installation,
the
user
glenda
will
do.
</p>

<a name="EDIT_CPURC,_CPURC.LOCAL" /><h3>EDIT CPURC, CPURC.LOCAL</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
first
step
is
to
edit
/rc/bin/cpurc*.
To
add
machine-specific
customisations,
</p>

<pre>
cd /cfg; mkdir $sysname; dircp example $sysname
</pre>

<p class='para'>
and
edit
the
files
in
/cfg/$sysname.
You
will
find
that
/rc/bin/cpurc
already
contains
most
of
the
needed
instructions
but
most
of
them
have
been
commented
out.
See
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/cpurc"><i>cpurc</i>(8)</a>
for
details.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
cpurc
for
a
specific
$sysname
host
is
executed
right
after
the
prompt
setup
in
the
/rc/bin/cpurc
file
that
will
execute
on
a
CPU
server
once
it
is
booted.
The
rest
of
/rc/bin/cpurc
will
execute
after
your
customized
cpurc
is
finished.
This
allows
you
to
keep
the
common
bits
of
CPU
server
setup
common
and
any
specifics
in
separate
files
per
$sysname.
Note
that
system-specific
scripts
are
also
run
at
the
end
of
the
cpurc.
The
sequence
is:
/rc/bin/cpurc
&gt;
/cfg/$sysname/cpurc
&gt;
/rc/bin/cpurc
&gt;
/cfg/$sysname/cpustart.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Individual
$sysname
bindings
can
be
set
in
either
plan9.ini
in
your
9fat
partition
(more
about
that
below),
or
in
/lib/ndb/local
by
the
particular
machine's
ethernet
mac
address.
</p>

<p class='para'>
At
the
end
of
/rc/bin/cpurc.local,
you
may
wish
to
bind
any
devices
you'll
need.
'cat
/dev/drivers'
will
list
the
available
devices.
In
this
case
we
have
m
(mouse),
i
(draw),
S
(sd
-
disk),
and
t
(uart
-
serial);
if
you
get

about
/dev/realmode,
include

</p>

<pre>

	bind -a '#'^$i /dev &gt;/dev/null &gt;[2=1]
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Uncomment
the
invocation
of
ip/ipconfig
in
/cfg/$sysname/cpurc,

ip/ipconfig -g &lt;gateway-addr&gt; ether /net/ether0 &lt;ip-addr&gt; &lt;ip-mask&gt;
</pre>

<p class='para'>
For
other
network
configurations
see
<a href="../network_configuration">network

</p>

<p class='para'>
Uncomment
the
two
lines
indicated
if
you
wish
to
be
able
to
boot
other
systems
from
this
server.
Note
that
on
home
networks
running
an
additional
dhcp
server
may
not
be
desirable.
</p>

<pre>
#ip/dhcpd

</pre>

<p class='para'>
Uncomment
the
two

indicated
in
/rc/bin/cpurc

enable
the
authentication
functions:
</p>

<pre>
# auth/keyfs -wp -m /mnt/keys /adm/keys &gt;/dev/null &gt;[2=1]
# auth/cron &gt;&gt;/sys/log/cron &gt;[2=1] &amp;
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Add
these
lines
to
/cfg/$sysname/cpustart,

run
after
auth/keyfs
</p>

<pre>
aux/listen -q -t /rc/bin/service.auth -d /rc/bin/service tcp

</pre>

<p class='para'>
to
enable
the

</p>

<p class='para'>
The
file
names
indicate
the
port

protocol,
and
the
file
itself
contains
the
commands
for
starting
a
service.
The
authsrv.
and
!
prefixes
indicate
disabled
services;
adding

removing
the
prefix
disables
or
enables
the
service.
The
original
/rc/bin/service/il566
and
/rc/bin/service/tcp567
services
were
proxy
calls
for
the
authentication
services
to
be
used
by
terminals.
We
don't
need
these
on
the
authentication
server,
but
you
may
on
other
cpu
servers.

<p class='para'>
Note:
To
export
a

<p class='para'>
Note
the

<a name="INSTALL_A_STANDALONE_CPU/AUTH_KERNEL" /><h3>INSTALL A STANDALONE CPU/AUTH KERNEL</h3>

<p class='para'>
You

use
a
cpu/auth

which
is
not
hard
to
compile:
</p>

<pre>
cd /sys/src/9/pc

<p class='para'>
See

Once

</p>

<pre>
9fat:

<p class='para'>
where
sdXX
is
the
disk
with
the
9fat
partition,
eg.,
sdC0.
</p>

<p class='para'>
it
is
recommended
to
include
a
menu
in
plan9.ini
which
will
give
you
a
choice
of
which
kernel
to
boot.
This
is
particularly
useful
if
things
don't
go
quite
as
planned,
such
as
your
CPU

not
having
all
the

you
needed.

<pre>

</pre>

<pre>
[4e]
bootfile=sdC0!9fat!9pcf
bootfile=sdC0!9fat!9pccpuf

</p>

<a name="NVRAM_DISK_PARTITION" /><h3>NVRAM DISK PARTITION</h3>

<p class='para'>
To
support
the
security
features
of
the
authentication
server,
a
section
of
disk
is
required
to
simulate
non-volatile
ram
(NVRAM).
</p>

<p class='para'>
This
partition
should
have
been
created
by
the
installer,
check
for
/dev/sdC0/nvram
(or
whatever
is
correct
for
your
disk
drive.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
this
is
missing
you
can
create
a
sub-partition
inside
the
Plan
9
partition
using
disk/prep.
The
sub-partition
should
be
called
'nvram',
eg:
</p>

<pre>
disk/prep /dev/sdC0/plan9
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Adjust
the
above
command
to
refer
to
your
plan9
disk
partition.
Then
you
can
delete
the
'swap'
sub-partition,
and
replace
it
with
a
swap
partition
that
is
1
sector
smaller
than
the
original.
In
the
free
space,
create
a
partition
called
'nvram'.
It
only
needs
to
be
1
sector
in
size.
Again,
this
should
not
be
needed
usually
as
the
installer
should
have
created
the
partition
for
you.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
you
need
to
invalidate
the
nvram
contents
so
that
the
checksum
won't
be
correct
when
you
next
boot.
This
will
force
the
cpu
server
to
ask
you
for
authentication
information.
</p>

<pre>
echo blahblahblah &gt;/dev/sdC0/nvram
</pre>

<a name="REBOOT" /><h3>REBOOT</h3>

<p class='para'>
Reboot
the
machine.
When
it
comes
up,
it
should
load
the
new
kernel
(or
ask
you
to
select
a
kernel
if
you
created
a
boot
menu)
and
then
complain
about
the
nvram
checksum
being
incorrect.
</p>

<p class='para'>
It
will
ask
for
an
authid,
authdom,
secstore
key,
and
password.
The
authid
is
the
host
owner
name,
usually
'bootes'.
The
authdom
is
a
non-empty
domain
(e.g.
moscvax.edu)
of
your
choosing
(for
debugging),
and
the
secstore
key
and
password
should
be
secret
password
of
8
characters
or
greater
in
length.
Remember
the
password,
you
will
need
it
again
later
when
creating
the
'bootes'
user.
</p>

<a name="AUTHENTICATION_SERVER_CONFIGURATION" /><h3>AUTHENTICATION SERVER CONFIGURATION</h3>

<p class='para'>
Firstly,
you
must
set
the
password
for
bootes
using
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/auth"><i>auth</i>(8)</a>
and
the
password
you
just
entered
during
bootup:
</p>

<pre>
auth/changeuser bootes
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Assign
the
password.
You
can
ignore
the
Inferno/POP
secret
if
you
won't
need
it,
it
may
be
the
same
as
the
Plan
9
password.
The
other
fields
are
optional.
</p>

<p class='para'>
After
this
you
can
use
auth/changeuser
to
create
accounts
for
other
users
that
will
be
allowed
in

Remember
to
add
them
also
the

<a name="ADDITIONAL_STEPS" /><h3>ADDITIONAL STEPS</h3>

<p class='para'>
If
you
want
to
set
up
a
Plan
9
file

server
from
it,
read
also

We
strongly
recommend
this,
