#IDEAS
#
# *	IdeaName (author/mentor) - one line summary, put long description
#	in a wiki link
# *	[v9fs-userspace] - userspace mount helper and server (based on
#	spfs)
# *	[olpc-inferno] - work on the OLPC hosted inferno environment and
#	apps
# *	[p9-scm] - Plan 9 native source control system with a venti
#	backend

#	implementation details for the Nintendo ds Inferno port. The
#	project homepage is [here | http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/]
# *	[svg support] - provide libraries under Inferno or Plan 9 to
#	support SVG.
# *	[iPhone drawterm] - use iPhone SDK to create a drawterm-like
#	application.
# *	[Inferno hosted video] - hosted device driver for Inferno
# *	[more Inferno projects |
#	http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/wiki/Project_Suggestions] -
#	Inferno project suggestions on Google Code, including summer
#	projects (some of them would be simplified, based on experience of
#	GSoC2007)
# *	[Native Omero] (nemo) - Viewer for o/mero system on a mainstream
#	OS using that OS's "native" widgets.
# *	[Omero on Plan 9] (nemo) - Port the o/mero window system to Plan
#	9.
# *	[Firefox Plugin] (nemo) - Port the MSIE plug-in to Firefox.
# *	[XYZ Shell] (caerwyn) - Implement an xy shell for namespace
#	command, as per [IPN lab 78 |
#	http://www.caerwyn.com/ipn/2007/07/lab-78-dynamic-dispatch.html]
# *	[lguest on Plan 9] (rminnich) - Make lguest run on Plan 9,
#	allowing Plan 9 to host another OS, like Linux.
# *	[Plan 9 on lguest 2.6.24] (rminnich) - Update the Plan 9 lguest
#	support to 2.6.24.
# *	[JIT for fixed precision arithmetic] (caerwyn) - Write the JIT
#	for ARM and x86 architectures to support the newish fixed precision
#	in Limbo.
# *	[Extend Jwin] (caerwyn) - Extend Jwin from [IPN lab 79 |
#	http://www.caerwyn.com/ipn/2007/07/lab-79-acme-javascript.html] to
#	support more of the real world's interfaces.
# *	[Eclipse Plugin] (caerwyn) - Implement the Eclipse filesystem
#	provider interface via styx.
# *	[IP path MTU discovery] (quanstro) - Allow Plan 9's IP stack to
#	discover MTU of its path to target.
# *	[Boot from USB root] (quanstro) - Add needed elements for Plan 9
#	to bood from USB.
# *	Port Inferno/EMU (maht) to Symbian Series 60
# *	Port Inferno/EMU (maht) to Python - useful for use on Python
#	enabled mobile phones such as Symbian Series 60 or those with
#	[Python interpreters built in |
#	http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=7917]
# *	[usb-debug-port] (Eckhardt) - Grimy driver hacking to support USB
#	"debug port"
# *	[usb-vga] (Eckhardt) - User-space device driver for a USB VGA
#	adaptor
# *	[usb-wifi] (Eckhardt) - User-space device driver for a USB WiFi
#	adaptor
# *	9p implementations in other languages (see below):
# *	Finish server-side [PHP implementation |
#	http://www.kix.in/projects/web9/] from last year
# *	bring outdated implementations (Python, most importantly) back to
#	current status and make them appear in the standard distributions
#	for those languages
# *	Perl-9p (andrey) name says it all
# *	Other programming languages for Plan 9 (see below):
# *	Ocaml (andrey) -- Ocaml has a compiler all its own and the
#	bytecode interpreter is ported to Plan 9. No idea how much work
#	this will require, but it will definitely be less than the work
#	required to get gcc in plan 9. Ocaml is a good language
# *	Scripting languages in Plan 9 (andrey): Updated and working
#	versions of python and perl for Plan 9. Emphasys should be put on
#	having a working GUI modules for Plan 9
# *	Distributed Computing (see below; the things here may be a bigger
#	byte)
# *	Unified library for writing synthetic file servers in distributed
#	computing infrastructures: a standard set of files and commands
#	operating on them so that we have common language between different
#	parts of a computing environment
# *	v9fs Auth: Finish authentication for v9fs; both plan9-style (auth
#	server) and xcpy-style (challenge/response)
# *	[m-o-a-f] (skip) mother-of-all-fs or filterfs. experiment with
#	devising and adding a language to exportfs and measure its
#	usability for writing filters and simple file servers.
# *	vbackup/vnfs for Windows to archive NTFS filesystems using the
#	volume shadowing service API
