Plan 9 provides the usual complement of ftp, telnet, and rexec
clients and servers though the servers require secure
challenge/response authentication using either a securenet(8) card or
a software simulation of it.

 *	Plan 9 has an ssh client and server, though these support only
	SSHv1 at present, though SSHv2 is in progress (see TODO list).
	Alternatively an OpenSSH port is available as a contrib(1) package,
	though sadly this fails to integrate with factotum(4) making it
	rather clunky to use.

To enable ssh v1 under OpenSSH on a debian based Linux machine. First
ensure the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file contains the lines:
! Protocol 2,1
! HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
Then run the following commands as root:
! ssh-keygen -t rsa1 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
! chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
! /etc/init.d/ssh restart
No doubt other linuices are similar, but slightly different.

 *	NFS filesystems may be imported into a Plan 9 system using nfs(4),
	Plan 9 also has an NFS server nfsserver(8) which may export parts of
	a Plan 9 file server to foreign systems.

 *	Posix systems may share their filesystems by running u9fs(4)
	(usually invoked from inetd) which exports some or all of the local
	filesystem to a remote Plan 9 system using the native Plan 9 file
	protocol. Can run from inetd or start from Plan 9 using [srvssh].

 *	Netware filesystems may be imported using ncpfs(4) which is
	distributed separately from the main Plan 9 release in
	/n/sources/contrib/steve/ncpfs.tar.bz2

 *	CIFS (Windows or samba) filesystems may be imported using cifs
	which is distributed separately from the main Plan 9 release by
	Steve Simon. To get it, you will first need Federico Benevento's
	contrib system, and then CIFS:
!      9fs sources # if not already done
!      /n/sources/contrib/fgb/root/rc/bin/contrib/install fgb/contrib # get contrib system
!      contrib/install steve/cifs # get CIFS

 *	Plan 9 files may be served to windows clients with aquarela(8).

 *	Plan 9 provides a vnc(1) client and server. (see [Using vncv])

 *	Another option using the native 9p protocol is the [hubfs] shell
	multiplexer. It functions similarly to screen/tmux and allows
	persistent shells shared from another operating system to Plan 9 and
	vice versa. It is found in contrib/mycroftiv/hubfs1.1.
