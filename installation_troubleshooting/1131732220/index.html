Please
first
read
the
<a href="../../Installer_Errata">Installer
Errata</a>
to
see
if
you
have
hit
a
known
bug;
then
if
after
going
thru
this
page
you
still
have
a
problem
you
can
reproduce,
please
add
it
to
the
list
of
known
problems.
<p class='para'>
The
initial
bootstrap
of
a
new
operating
system
on
new
hardware
is
often
problematic.
Here
follow
some
suggestions
that
might
help
you
clear
some
hurdles.
</p>

<p class='para'>
First,
check
the
<a href="../../supported_PC_hardware">supported
PC
hardware</a>
list
to
make
sure
the
hardware
you're
running
is
supported.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Your
plan9.ini
file
must
be
an
accurate
description
of
the
machine.
The
first
line
of
defense
is
therefore
to
look
at
the
plan9.ini
file
and
edit
it.
The
floppy
is
a
DOS
floppy,
so
you
should
be
able
to
edit
plan9.ini
from
a
Windows
machine
or
other
system.
</p>

<p class='para'>
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/9load"><i>9load</i>(8)</a>
is
the
program
that
loads
and
starts
the
kernel.
It
needs
to
find
and
load
the
kernel,
based
on
plan9.ini
and
the
hardware
it
can
discover.
The
last
line
9load
prints
before
loading
the
kernel
is
<pre>
  entry: 0x80100020
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
don't
see
that
line,
then
your
problem
is
with
9load.
In
this
case,
you
can
turn
on
debugging
by
typing
a
control-R
at
any
time
while
it's
running.
Even
if
the
debugging
output
doesn't
help
you,
what's
printed
might
help
others,
so
make
notes.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
there
are
problems
during
the
boot
of
the
CD,
try
some
combinations
of
the
boot
parameters:
sdXX!cdboot!9pcflop.gz,
where:
C0
is
Primary
Master,
C1
is
Primary
Slave,
D0
is
Secondary
Master
and
D1
is
the
Secondary
Slave.
</p>

<p class='para'>
On
some
Linux
systems
and
running
in
vmware4,
it
seems
9load
hangs
at
bootup,
before
it
finds
plan9.ini.
When
9load
starts
running
at
physical
address
0x10000,
and
later
at
0x80010000,
in
order
to
find
configuration
information,
it
searches
all
units
on
devices
fd
and
sdCn,
in
that
order,
for
a
file
called
plan9\plan9.ini
or
plan9.ini
on
a
partition
named
dos
or
9fat.
Unfortunately,
if
you
are
running
vmware
4
under
GNU/Linux,
and
you
have
loaded
the
scsi-ide
emulation
layer
in
linux
(maybe
to
use
your
CDRW),
9load
will
probably
hang.
In
order
to
solve
the
problem,
you
need
to
use
an
iso
image
for
you
cd
drive
virtual
device,
making
sure
the
iso
image
does
not
contain
a
dos
partition.
VMware
comes
with
a
linux.iso
sample
image
(/usr/{whatever}/lib/vmware/isoimages/linux.iso),
which
can
be
used
in
this
rare
situations.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
first
line
the
kernel
prints
is
the
CPU
identification.
For
example,
you
might
see:
<pre>
  cpu0: 40 MHz GenuineIntel 386SX
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
If
this
(or
a
similar)
line
is
printed,
your
problem
is
with
the
kernel
rather
than
9load.
(If
you
see
the
entry:
line
above
but
not
the
cpu0:
line,
it
could
be
either
9load
or
the
kernel
causing
trouble.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
the
kernel
hangs
after
printing
"kfs...version...time...",
something
in
the
startup
scripts
has
failed.
To
see
each
command
before
it
is
executed,
add
the
line
"debug=1"
to
your
plan9.ini.
Also,
while
the
kernel
is
hung,
press
the
following:
Ctl-t,
Ctl-t,
p.
This
will
print
a
process
listing.
Look
for
the
few
lines
with
the
largest
numbers
in
the
first
column,
and
note
their
names
(the
names
look
like
kfs,
ipconfig,
genrandom).
That
will
help
determine
which
program
is
hanging.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
the
kernel
reboots
before
you
get
a
chance
to
read
what
is
on
the
screen,
you
might
try
attaching
a
serial
console
and
adding
the
line
"console=0"
or
"console=1"
to
send
kernel
output
to
DOS's
COM1
or
COM2
as
well
as
the
screen.
The
serial
console
will
run
at
9600
baud,
8-bits,
no
parity,
and
1
stop
bit.

<a name="VIDEO_PROBLEMS" /><h3>VIDEO PROBLEMS</h3>

<p class='para'>
If
the
kernel
gets
running
but
the
VGA
doesn't
turn
on,
you
may
need
to
play
with
the
screen
settings.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
the
screen
goes
black
and
you
see
nothing,
aux/vga
(see
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/vga"><i>vga</i>(8)</a>)
thinks
it
recognizes
your
video
card,
but
either
the
monitor
settings
being
used
are
incorrect
or
aux/vga
doesn't
really
know
everything
it
needs
to
program
your
card.
In
this
case
you
might
try
a
smaller
screen
resolution,
starting
at
640x480x8
and
working
up.
A
640x480
screen
is
perfectly
adequate
for
the
installation.
If
you
are
using
an
LCD,
you
should
use
the
exact
size
of
the
LCD;
aux/vga
sometimes
has
problems
stretching
smaller
resolutions
on
LCDs.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
the
kernel
doesn't
switch
into
VGA
mode
but
continues
to
run
in
CGA
mode,
along
with
a
complaint
along
the
lines
of
"no
frame
buffer"
and
a
shell
prompt
(%),
the
system
doesn't
recognize
your
video
card
at
all.

<p class='para'>
Aux/vga
will
have
left
a

VDA
cards
are
identified
by
matching
text
in
their
bios
with
the
list
of
know
strings
in
/lib/vgadb.
If
your
card
is
not
identified
it
may
only
be
because
it
has
different
text
in
its
bios
(E.G.
a
different
copyright
message),
or
it
may
be
wholy
unsupported
(see
<a href="../../Supported_PC_hardware">Supported
PC
hardware</a>).
</p>

<p class='para'>
Look
through
the
strings
in
the
hex
dump
for
a
text
string
which
describes
your
card,
write
this
down
together
with
the
address
it
starts
at.
Now
create
a
RAM
/tmp
file
system
and
edit
/lib/vgadb
using
the
venerable
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/ed"><i>ed</i>(1)</a>
editor.
Search
for
a
similar
entry,
and
append
your
new
one
after
it.

will
now
be

If
your
Card
is
not
supported
but
you
can
find
out
the
exact
chip
type
--
such
as
by
looking
in
the
hardware
manual,
the
Display
Properties
in
Windows
95,
98,
or
NT,
or
the
configuration
information
used
by
a
Unix-like
system
--
see
if
/lib/vgadb
supports
it.
You
can
then
add
an
entry
for
that
device
as
above,
however
adding
an
BIOS
string
to
a
random
chip
type
type
is
unlikely
to
be
successfull.

<p class='para'>
If
you
have
other

it
can't

to
try
a
different
one.

<p class='para'>
Before
invoking
aux/vga
to
start
the
VGA,
the
floppy
boot
script
writes
the
output
of
"aux/vga
-vip"
to
the
file
vgainfo.txt
in
the
root
directory
of
the
floppy
disk.
It
also
writes
the
output
of
"pci"
to
the
file
pci.txt.
Both
are
useful
for
debugging
unrecognized
cards.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
boot
disk
uses
the
vgadb
file
from
the
root
directory
of
the
floppy
disk
as
/lib/vgadb,
to
make
it
possible
to
edit
on
other
systems.
Note
that
vgadb
now
identifies
cards
both
using
BIOS
strings
and
using
PCI
identifiers,
the
latter
being
the
preferred
method
of
identification
since
it
is
more
general.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Sometimes
it
suffices
to
add
some
information
to
/lib/vgadb;
if
you
find
this
to
be
true,
please
let
us
know
so
we
can
update
our
master
database.

If
your
system
prints
"no
physical
memory"
during
the
installation
but
you
have
at
least
32MB
of
memory,
then
perhaps
your
BIOS
is
not
reporting
it
in
a
way
that
Plan
9
understands.
Some
BIOSes
have
an
option
to
"report
alternative
memory".
Try
toggling
it.
(If
that
doesn't
work,
the
*maxmem=
entry
in
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/plan9.ini"><i>plan9.ini</i>(8)</a>
will
override
anything
the

reports.)
