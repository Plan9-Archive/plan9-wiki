Please first read the [Installer Errata] to see if you have hit a
known bug; then if after going thru this page you still have a
problem you can reproduce, please add it to the list of known
problems.

The initial bootstrap of a new operating system on new hardware is
often problematic. Here follow some suggestions that might help you
clear some hurdles.

First, check the [supported PC hardware] list to make sure the
hardware you're running is supported.

Your plan9.ini file must be an accurate description of the machine.
The first line of defense is therefore to look at the plan9.ini file
and edit it. The floppy is a DOS floppy, so you should be able to
edit plan9.ini from a Windows machine or other system.

9load(8) is the program that loads and starts the kernel. It needs to
find and load the kernel, based on plan9.ini and the hardware it can
discover. The last line 9load prints before loading the kernel is
!   entry: 0x80100020

If you don't see that line, then your problem is with 9load. In this
case, you can turn on debugging by typing a control-R at any time
while it's running. Even if the debugging output doesn't help you,
what's printed might help others, so make notes.

If there are problems during the boot of the CD, try some
combinations of the boot parameters: sdXX!cdboot!9pcflop.gz, where:
C0 is Primary Master, C1 is Primary Slave, D0 is Secondary Master and
D1 is the Secondary Slave.

On some Linux systems and running in vmware4, it seems 9load hangs at
bootup, before it finds plan9.ini. When 9load starts running at
physical address 0x10000, and later at 0x80010000, in order to find
configuration information, it searches all units on devices fd and
sdCn, in that order, for a file called plan9\plan9.ini or plan9.ini
on a partition named dos or 9fat. Unfortunately, if you are running
vmware 4 under GNU/Linux, and you have loaded the scsi-ide emulation
layer in linux (maybe to use your CDRW), 9load will probably hang. In
order to solve the problem, you need to use an iso image for you cd
drive virtual device, making sure the iso image does not contain a
dos partition. VMware comes with a linux.iso sample image
(/usr/{whatever}/lib/vmware/isoimages/linux.iso), which can be used
in this rare situations.

The first line the kernel prints is the CPU identification. For
example, you might see:
!   cpu0: 40 MHz GenuineIntel 386SX

If this (or a similar) line is printed, your problem is with the
kernel rather than 9load. (If you see the entry: line above but not
the cpu0: line, it could be either 9load or the kernel causing
trouble.)

If the kernel hangs after printing "kfs...version...time...",
something in the startup scripts has failed. To see each command
before it is executed, add the line "debug=1" to your plan9.ini.
Also, while the kernel is hung, press the following: Ctl-t, Ctl-t, p.
This will print a process listing. Look for the few lines with the
largest numbers in the first column, and note their names (the names
look like kfs, ipconfig, genrandom). That will help determine which
program is hanging.

If the kernel reboots before you get a chance to read what is on the
screen, you might try attaching a serial console and adding the line
"console=0" or "console=1" to send kernel output to DOS's COM1 or
COM2 as well as the screen. The serial console will run at 9600 baud,
8-bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit.

VIDEO PROBLEMS

If the kernel gets running but the VGA doesn't turn on, you may need
to play with the screen settings.

If the screen goes black and you see nothing, aux/vga (see vga(8))
thinks it recognizes your video card, but either the monitor settings
being used are incorrect or aux/vga doesn't really know everything it
needs to program your card. In this case you might try a smaller
screen resolution, starting at 640x480x8 and working up. A 640x480
screen is perfectly adequate for the installation. If you are using
an LCD, you should use the exact size of the LCD; aux/vga sometimes
has problems stretching smaller resolutions on LCDs.

If the kernel doesn't switch into VGA mode but continues to run in
CGA mode, along with a complaint along the lines of "no frame buffer"
and a shell prompt (%), the system doesn't recognize your video card
at all.

Aux/vga will have left a hex dump of your VGA BIOS memory on the
screen VDA cards are identified by matching text in their bios with
the list of know strings in /lib/vgadb. If your card is not
identified it may only be because it has different text in its bios
(E.G. a different copyright message), or it may be wholy unsupported
(see [Supported PC hardware]).

Look through the strings in the hex dump for a text string which
describes your card, write this down together with the address it
starts at. Now create a RAM /tmp file system and edit /lib/vgadb
using the venerable ed(1) editor. Search for a similar entry, and
append your new one after it.

! ramfs
! ed /lib/vgadb
! 28683
! /Stealth/
! 			0xC0045="Stealth 64 Vers. 1.05"
! a
! 			0xC0045="Stealth 64 Vers. 2.03"
! .
! w
! 28712
! q

You will now be able to restart the install process by typing

! aux/vga -l $resolution^'x'^$depth
! rio -i /bin/inst/gui

If your Card is not supported but you can find out the exact chip
type -- such as by looking in the hardware manual, the Display
Properties in Windows 95, 98, or NT, or the configuration information
used by a Unix-like system -- see if /lib/vgadb supports it. You can
then add an entry for that device as above, however adding an BIOS
string to a random chip type type is unlikely to be successfull.

If you have other video cards, it can't hurt to try a different one.

Before invoking aux/vga to start the VGA, the floppy boot script
writes the output of "aux/vga -vip" to the file vgainfo.txt in the
root directory of the floppy disk. It also writes the output of "pci"
to the file pci.txt. Both are useful for debugging unrecognized cards.

The boot disk uses the vgadb file from the root directory of the
floppy disk as /lib/vgadb, to make it possible to edit on other
systems. Note that vgadb now identifies cards both using BIOS strings
and using PCI identifiers, the latter being the preferred method of
identification since it is more general.

Sometimes it suffices to add some information to /lib/vgadb; if you
find this to be true, please let us know so we can update our master
database.

The Installer can run in text mode if your video card is not
detected, but for reference here is an old guide of how to do a
manual install in text mode:

MEMORY PROBLEMS

If your system prints "no physical memory" during the installation
but you have at least 32MB of memory, then perhaps your BIOS is not
reporting it in a way that Plan 9 understands. Some BIOSes have an
option to "report alternative memory". Try toggling it. (If that
doesn't work, the *maxmem= entry in plan9.ini(8) will override
anything the BIOS reports.)

BOOT LOADER

If you encounter troubles booting plan9 from lilo, see
[troubleshooting plan9 & lilo].

As a last resort, look in the [comp.os.plan9 archives |
http://lists.cse.psu.edu/archives/9fans], ask in comp.os.plan9, or
mail the Bell Labs Plan 9 trouble line 9trouble@plan9.bell-labs.com.

If you mail 9trouble, please include the contents of plan9.ini(8),
vgainfo.txt, and pci.txt from your boot floppy, as well as any
hardware information gleaned from other sources.

Finally, if you resolve a problem via some method not listed here,
edit this page (see bottom) to tell the world about it!
