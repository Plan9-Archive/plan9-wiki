TeX Configuration

Auriel (82.182.149.46)
#The Plan 9 documentation is in troff; however, TeX has been compiled
#and brought up under the ANSI/POSIX Environment (APE). It is a
#separate package from the main distribution due to its size.
#
#The TeX distribution can be found in /n/sources/extra/tex.iso.bz2
#
#This is a TeX distribution that uses the kpathsearch modifications;
#the main library tree is kept in /sys/lib/texmf.
#
#DVIPS
#
#The Plan 9 TeX installation defines three dvips printer drivers (to
#use with dvips -Pdrivername): ps, psfonts, and bitmapfonts. The
#appropriate driver to use depends on the intended use of the output.
#
# *	The ps driver (the default) generates Postscript files with
#	references to the Postscript versions of any TeX fonts. These fonts
#	are kept in subdirectories of /sys/lib/postscript/font. The files
#	are small, are generated quickly, and work well with page(1) and
#	lp(8), but since the Postscript versions of the TeX fonts are not
#	commonly installed elsewhere, they are not particularly good for
#	giving to friends or posting on web pages.
# *	The psfonts driver generates Postscript files with reference to
#	the Postscript versions of the TeX fonts, and also includes the
#	fonts in the Postscript file. The files are fairly large, generated
#	quickly, and are attractive when viewed in Postscript previewers or
#	turned into PDF via Acrobat Distiller.
# *	The bitmapfonts driver is equivalent to the default on most dvips
#	systems. Bitmap versions of the TeX fonts are included in the
#	output files, making them larger than `ps' but smaller than
#	`psfonts' files, slow to generate, and not particularly attractive
#	when viewed on screen.
#
#ADDING SUPPORT FOR OTHER LANGUAGES
#
#To add hyphenation patterns for other languages, do the following.
#
# *	Uncomment the desired language patterns in
#	/sys/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat
#
# *	Make new TeX fmt files:
#
#! cd /sys/src/cmd/tex/web2c/tex
#! rm *.fmt
#! mk install-fmt
#
#It gives errors saying that a file is too old. Go to the file and
#change the date from 1999 to 200x. Repeat.
