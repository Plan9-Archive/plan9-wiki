The Plan 9 documentation is in troff; however, TeX has been compiled
and brought up under the ANSI/POSIX Environment (APE). It is a
separate package from the main distribution due to its size.

The TeX distribution can be found in /n/sources/extra/tex.iso.bz2

This is a TeX distribution that uses the kpathsearch modifications;
the main library tree is kept in /sys/lib/texmf.

DVIPS

The Plan 9 TeX installation defines three dvips printer drivers (to
use with dvips -Pdrivername): ps, psfonts, and bitmapfonts. The
appropriate driver to use depends on the intended use of the output.

 *	The ps driver (the default) generates Postscript files with
	references to the Postscript versions of any TeX fonts. These fonts
	are kept in subdirectories of /sys/lib/postscript/font. The files
	are small, are generated quickly, and work well with page(1) and
	lp(8), but since the Postscript versions of the TeX fonts are not
	commonly installed elsewhere, they are not particularly good for
	giving to friends or posting on web pages.
 *	The psfonts driver generates Postscript files with reference to
	the Postscript versions of the TeX fonts, and also includes the
	fonts in the Postscript file. The files are fairly large, generated
	quickly, and are attractive when viewed in Postscript previewers or
	turned into PDF via Acrobat Distiller.
 *	The bitmapfonts driver is equivalent to the default on most dvips
	systems. Bitmap versions of the TeX fonts are included in the output
	files, making them larger than `ps' but smaller than `psfonts'
	files, slow to generate, and not particularly attractive when viewed
	on screen.

ADDING SUPPORT FOR OTHER LANGUAGES

To add hyphenation patterns for other languages, do the following.

 *	Uncomment the desired language patterns in
	/sys/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat

 *	Make new TeX fmt files:

! cd /sys/src/cmd/tex/web2c/tex
! rm *.fmt
! mk install-fmt

It gives errors saying that a file is too old. Go to the file and
change the date from 1999 to 200x. Repeat.
