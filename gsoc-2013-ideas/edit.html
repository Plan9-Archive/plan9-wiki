Plan 9 and related technologies cover a huge range of topics. Below
we've put together a list of some ideas which we think would be good
candidates for stundents looking for summer-sized projects with us.
Each idea includes at least a brief description and a list of
"sponsors" for the idea (people who've suggested it or volunteered to
work with folks on it). Ideas are rated for estimated difficulty from
1 to 5 stars (1=easy, 5=hard) and may contain links to further
information or discussion.

Note! We actively encourage students to submit applications for
projects not on this list, too. We've accepted such projects three
out of four years we've participated. Plan 9 (and its cousins) embody
a different way of approaching problems, and we get most excited when
we see a student (or anyone, for that matter) apply those ideas to
their own set of problems.

In addition to this ideas page, prospective students should look over
our [GSoC Student Expectations] and be prepared to submit an
application matching our [GSoC Student Application]. For more
information, note our general [GSoC] page.

If you're looking for additional ideas, you might check out the todo,
bugs, and ideas lists for [Inferno |
http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/wiki/Project_Suggestions], [9atom
| http://www.quanstro.net/plan9/9atom/todo.html], and [Acme-SAC |
http://code.google.com/p/acme-sac/issues/list]. These lists are more
general and will not all be a good size for a summer, but are good
sources of inspiration. Some of the most promising fits are
duplicated below.

If you're a community member and you have an idea you'd be willing to
act as mentor for, please add it to this page! Just follow the format
given and provide a good summary of the project. If you'd like,
create and link a wiki page with as much detail as you'd like (but
please don't swamp this page). Please only add ideas you're willing
to mentor (or have directly spoken to whoever you're marking down as
mentor).

Several of these ideas have the title linked to a page containing
more information on the project.

------------------------------------------------------ 
GRAPHICS IDEAS

Ideas related to Plan 9's graphics systems, including kernel devices,
window systems, and supporting libraries.

 *	HTML5 based draw server ✪✪✪✪ (Skip Tavakkolian)

Implement the draw device capabilities -- draw(3) -- in HTML5
(Javascript), using Canvas graphics primitives and export the draw
hierarchy via 9P using the Websocket API. The client side can be
implemented relatively easily on Plan 9 using Go language and the
http and net/websocket packages and import(4). This has a potential
of becoming a universal GUI capability for Go language as well. This
is similar in approach to noVNC, but should be easier to implement.
The implementation can be simplified using either Dart (dart2js) or
Java (GWT), rather than using Javascript.

 *	Create an [alternative window system] ✪✪ (Anthony Sorace)

The Plan 9 windowing system is quite different from X11. Rendering is
handled by the kernel graphics driver itself, with a user-mode
application responsible for window management issues like placement,
sizing, labels, and visability. Today, the only such program is
rio(1). It would be fun to have a few alternatives. Design and
implement an alternative interface. Some popular ideas include tiling
interfaces (similar to acme(1) or X11's wmii or dwm), exploring
keyboard-driven control, or touch-based interaction.

A student looking to work on a project in this area should be
familiar with Plan 9's existing windowing system, including rio(1)
and draw(3), at a minimum. It would be good to also review some of
the rio hacks found in the [contrib index].

------------------------------------------------------ 
KERNEL IDEAS

Project ideas related to the kernel, the various ports, or driver
support. Note that we're always interested in ports to new hardware,
provided you can ensure that you and your mentors have the same
device. Pick anything and get Plan 9 working on it!

 *	lockdep for Plan 9 ✪✪✪✪✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

Linux includes a utility called lockdep which has been very helpful
for them in identifying and eliminating hard lockups caused by
improperly managed locks. A similar tool could be useful for Plan 9.
This is an ambitious project, likely best suited to a graduate-level
student already familiar with the Plan 9 kernel internals.

 *	ARM vfp kernel emulator ✪✪✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

The Plan 9 kernel for ARM runs on systems with both 7500-style and
the newer vfp floating point instructions. The kernel includes an
emulator for the 7500-style instructions, as well. Unfortunately,
this means that in mixed environments you can only safely assume
7500-style floating point. It would be nice to replace that emulator
with one which handles vfp, so we can safely generate those
instructions by default.

 *	[Raspberry Pi] work ✪✪✪ (Bakul Shah)

We have a port of Plan 9 to the Raspberry Pi which has proven very
popular. The port is stable and performs well, but there is more work
to be done. We could certainly use drivers for I²C, I²S, audio, gpio,
pwm, and spi. If you have compatible hardware, it might be neat to
take a look at the DSI or CSI-2 connectors (although note that
hardware for those is not common, and for hardware projects you must
ensure you and your mentor have the same kit). Oh, and those LEDs!
Put together a proposal for a set of drivers you'd be interested in
working on and a sample application.

------------------------------------------------------ 
WEB IDEAS

Project ideas related to the web, either in Plan 9 tools providing
web services or in ways to interact with Plan 9 systems.

 *	[OAuth] for factotum(4) ✪✪✪ (Anthony Sorace, Skip Tavakkolian)

OAuth is a very common method for users to provide authorization to
web services. To facilitate writing Plan 9 and Inferno clients for
many of these services, it would be nice to teach factotum(4) how to
speak OAuth. There are some design considerations that need to be
thought through; the models don't map directly. Add OAuth to either
the Plan 9 or Inferno factotums and write an example client.

While it isn't OAuth, [flickrfs |
https://bitbucket.org/bedo/flickrfs] has support for Flickr's
pre-OAuth authentication method, which has some similarities.
Interested students might look to it for reference or inspiration.

 *	[Replace language for wikifs](4) ✪ (Anthony Sorace)

The wikifs(4) in both Plan 9 and Inferno understand a very small set
of cues when generating HTML. That set can be limiting. Replace it
with something better, like Markdown. Markdown engines in C already
exist, so the Plan 9 part of this shouldn't be too hard. I'd suggest
doing the Inferno version as well, to make it a good summer sized
project. Use any remaining time to convert any existing wiki docs
that need it.

 *	Make wikifs(4) authenticate against an auth server ✪✪ (Anthony
	Sorace)

Our wikifs(4) doesn't currently do any authentication. Our web server
and supporting libraries have support for http authentication, but
using data stored in the file system directly. It would be nice if
web applications could authenticate against a real Plan 9
authentication server. A student submitting a proposal for this
should also investigate what's involved in getting wikifs working
over https (it shouldn't be much) to ensure passwords are submitted
securely.

 *	Make man2html produce better html ✪✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

The html generated by man2html (and related tools, like ms2html(1))
is serviceable but basic and outdated. Take a look at the output and
suggest a set of enhancements. Ideas include optional use of style
sheets and handling of preprocessors like pic(1) and tbl(1). The
difficulty of this project will depend on the scope of your specific
proposal.

------------------------------------------------------ 
DEV TOOLS IDEAS

Project ideas related to compilers, development tools, or supporting
libraries.

 *	FXR/LXR-like tree comparisons for Plan 9 ✪✪✪ (Anthony Sorace, Jeff
	Sickel)

[The LXR project | http://lxr.sourceforge.net] has created some very
useful tools for cross-referencing different source trees. This idea
has been productively expanded by [FXR | http://fxr.watson.org/] to
compare across operationg systems (FXR includes various BSDs,
Linuxes, and an old Plan 9 tree). As Plan 9 evolves, it would be very
useful to tree maintainers to have an easy way to find, track, and
explore differences between trees. This project would be to provide
tools to scan different source trees (the Bell Labs tree, 9atom, NIX,
NxM, 9front, possibly Inferno and Plan 9 from User Space) and allow
users to see specific changes, perhaps including changes over time.
Your proposal should describe the interface you're thinking about
providing (file server? web application?), what you think some of the
important issues are, and clearly define the scope of work (for
example, will you be doing multi-way diffs, or just 1-to-1
comparisons?). Multiple Plan 9 sites would be happy to host the
results of this work.

------------------------------------------------------ 
APPLICATION IDEAS

Ideas for applications; user-mode code in an existing environment.

 *	Port rtl-sdr to Plan 9 ✪✪✪ (Skip Tavakkolian)

[rtl-sdr | http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr] is a C library
that enables using the Realtek RTL2832U based DVB-T receivers as
Software Defined Radio receivers (SDR). These inexpensive USB dongles
($20-$30) have been used as receivers for a variety of signaling
systems and frequencies including ADS-B, GPS and GSM. Typically
additional signal processing is performed by GnuRadio on data
captured by rtl-sdr library. The main porting activity will involve
replacing the calls to [LibUSB | http://www.libusb.org/] with an
interface to Plan 9's usb server.

------------------------------------------------------ 
NETWORKING IDEAS

 *	Teach pcipl to pass dhcp leases to the kernel ✪✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

When booting off the network, the bootloader often does dhcp to
discover various network information. The lease given is discarded
once the kernel is running, and the kernel (typically) runs DHCP over
again itself, just to get the same information back. Teach pcipl (one
of the new generation of Plan 9 bootladers) to pass the lease to the
kernel (and teach the kernel how to accept it, of course). This can
make a difference on moderately-sized networks where the spanning
tree might take some time to run.

 *	Teach Plan 9 to speak mDNS/Bonjour ✪✪✪ (Jeff Sickel)

It would be nice for Plan 9 to be able to speak Bonjour. When in
heterogeneous networks, there are various services that Plan 9 cannot
serve without being able to do so. Get the protocol working and
integrate it with Plan 9's existing ndb/cs infrastructure.

 *	Add keyboard-interactive authentication to ssh2 ✪ (Steve Simon)

Plan 9's new ssh2 implementation does not currently implement the
keyboard-interactive authentication method. There are lots of systems
where this would be very useful. Add it. This is almost certainly not
a summer-sized project on its own, but could be a good addition to
other projects, especially if you're already working on ssh,
factotum, or authentication.

 *	Write a 9P implementation in Dart ✪✪✪ (Charles Forsyth)

Plan 9 and Inferno represent services and resources as directories of
file-like names, that can be opened, read and written to use the
service. A single file service protocol, 9P, is used to implement and
access those services. Write the client-side implementation of 9P in
[Dart | http://www.dartlang.org/], to allow applications in web
browsers to access network resources and services that are
represented using 9P. The package should allow concurrent use of the
connection, multiplexing access to files within several remote name
spaces (mount points). 9P is also implemented by Linux (as *v9fs*),
which further extends the reach of this package.

------------------------------------------------------ 
OTHER IDEAS

Project ideas that don't fit into - or span multiple of - the above
catagories.

 *	Write a basic Dis interpreter for web browsers in Dart ✪✪✪
	(Charles Forsyth)

This involves both development tools and web ideas. Limbo programs
are currently compiled into a simple portable, concurrent,
memory-memory machine language called [Dis |
http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/dis.html]. It is then either
interpreted or compiled-on-the-fly into target machine code. I'd
quite like to write simple Limbo programs that will run in any web
browser. [Dart | http://www.dartlang.org] is a language from Google,
similar to C# or Java, which runs in web browsers, one way or another.

Starting with the existing Dis interpreter as a model, roughly 4,300
lines of C, write a Dis interpreter in Dart that will load and run a
non-trivial subset of Dis. It should include Dis processes, which
will be multiplexed within the interpreter, much as in the current
interpreter. It should include the current Sys module, or a large
subset, but is unlikely to include Draw.

The advantage of Dart over (say) raw JavaScript is that most people
familiar with Java and especially C# ("Java with the bugs fixed")
should be able to pick up Dart quickly, and Dart already has an
extensive library of interfaces into the underlying web browser and
network, which might be useful. Another notation that compiles into
JavaScript could be used instead.
