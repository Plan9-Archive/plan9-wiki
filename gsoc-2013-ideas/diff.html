a

Below
we've
put
together
a
list
of
some
ideas
which
we
think
would
be
good
candidates
for
stundents
looking
for
summer-sized
projects
with
us.
Each
idea
includes
at

a
brief

and
a
list
of
"sponsors"
for
the
idea
(people
who've
suggested
it
or
volunteered
to
work
with
folks
on
it).
Ideas
are
rated
for
estimated
difficulty
from
1
to
5
stars
(1=easy,
5=hard)
and
may
contain
links
to
further
information
or
discussion.

Note!
We
actively
encourage
students

submit

too.
We've
accepted
such
projects
three
out
of
four
years

participated.
Plan

(and
its
cousins)
embody
a
different
way
of
approaching
problems,
and
we
get
most
excited
when
we
see
a
student
(or
anyone,
for
that
matter)
apply
those
ideas
to
their
own
set
of
problems.

The

runs
on

both

The

an

Unfortunately,
this
means
that
in

you
can
only
safely
assume
7500-style
floating

It

be
nice
to

OAuth

To

There
are
some

be
thought
through;
the

don't
map

Add
OAuth

When

the

dhcp

The
lease
given

discarded
once

the

runs
DHCP
over

<ul>

<li>
Write
a
basic
Dis
interpreter
for
web
browsers
in
Dart
✪✪✪
(Charles
Forsyth)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
This
involves
both
development
tools
and
web
ideas.
Limbo
programs
are
currently
compiled
into
a
simple
portable,
concurrent,
memory-memory
machine
language
called
<a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/dis.html">Dis</a>.
It
is
then
either
interpreted
or
compiled-on-the-fly
into
target
machine
code.
I'd
quite
like
to
write
simple
Limbo
programs
that
will
run
in
any
web
browser.
<a href="http://www.dartlang.org">Dart</a>
is
a
language
from
Google,
similar
to
C#
or
Java,
which
runs
in
web
browsers,
one
way
or
another.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Starting
with
the
existing
Dis
interpreter
as
a
model,
roughly
4,300
lines
of
C,
write
a
Dis
interpreter
in
Dart
that
will
load
and
run
a
non-trivial
subset
of
Dis.
It
should
include
Dis
processes,
which
will
be
multiplexed
within
the
interpreter,
much
as
in
the
current
interpreter.
It
should
include
the
current
Sys
module,
or
a
large
subset,
but
is
unlikely
to
include
Draw.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
advantage
of
Dart
over
(say)
raw
JavaScript
is
that
most
people
familiar
with
Java
and
especially
C#
("Java
with
the
bugs
fixed")
should
be
able
to
pick
up
Dart
quickly,
and
Dart
already
has
an
extensive
library
of
interfaces
into
the
underlying
web
browser
and
network,
which
might
be
useful.
Another
notation
that
compiles
into
JavaScript
could
be
used
instead.
