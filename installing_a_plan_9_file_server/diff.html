<p class='para'>
Installing
a
Plan
9
file
server
can
be
a
bewildering
experience
for
a
new
user.
This
document
is
intended
to
take
some
of
the
guesswork
out
of
it.
Also
read
<a href="../Upgrading_to_fourth_edition">Upgrading

edition</a>
for
some
important
fourth
edition
details.
</p>

<p class='para'>
When
installing
a
Plan
9
network,
the
file
server
should
be
one
of
the
first
machines
set
up,
immediately
after
a
standalone
CPU/authentication
server.
The
installation
is
fairly
easy
once
one
knows
the
steps
to
follow
and
understands
what
is
happening.
</p>

<p class='para'>
This
information
is
cribbed
from
many
other
sources,
including
several
manual
pages,
installation
instructions
from
the
2nd
edition
(found
online),
the
paper
by
Ken
Thompson
on
the
Plan
9
File
Server,
notes
from
the
9fans@cse.psu.edu
archives,
and
reading
the
code
in
/sys/src/fs.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Folks
who
are
curious
about
the
file
server
are
encouraged
to
read
any
available
reference
material.
In
particular,
read
the
manual
pages
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/fs"><i>fs</i>(4)</a>,
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/fs"><i>fs</i>(8)</a>,
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/fsconfig"><i>fsconfig</i>(8)</a>.
Also,
the
paper
``The
Plan
9
File
Server,''
by
Ken
Thompson
(available
in
Volume
2
of
the
manual,
or
via
``page
/sys/doc/fs/fs.ps'')
is
illuminating.
Further,
the
``Installing
the
Plan
9

document
from
the
second
edition
can
fill
in
a
few
of
the
holes,
and

at
<a href="ftp://ftp.dbsystems.com/pub/plan9/install.html">ftp://ftp.dbsystems.com/pub/plan9/install.html</a>.
This
wiki
provides
post-setup
installation
that
can
be
handy.
See
the
main
<a href="../plan_9_wiki">plan

page.
Finally,
the
9fans
archives,
available
on
the
web
at
<a href="http://lists.cse.psu.edu/archives/9fans/">http://lists.cse.psu.edu/archives/9fans/</a>
have
quite
a
bit
of
collected
wisdom
in
them,
and
are
well
worth
a
read
when
you
run
into
a
snag.
Broadly
outlined,
the
steps
for
file
server
installation
are
as
follows:
<ul>

<li>
creating
a
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/plan9.ini"><i>plan9.ini</i>(8)</a>
file
describing
the
file
server
hardware
</li>

<li>
creating
a
boot
floppy
with
a
file
server
kernel
</li>

<li>
setting
network
parameters
and
initializing
the
filesystem
on
disk
</li>

<li>
setting
authentication
information
in
nvram
or
on
the
floppy
</li>

<li>
populating
the
server
with
data
and
user
information
</li>

<li>
rebooting
to
come
up
in
``normal''
mode
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p class='para'>
To
begin,
pick
a
machine
on
the
network
that
is
going
to
be
the
Plan
9
file
server.
This
machine
will
run
a
specialized
kernel,
and
will
be
dedicated
to
serving
files.
It
cannot,
for
instance,
double
as
a
CPU
or
authentication
server.
In
normal
usage
at
Bell
Labs,
magnetic
disk
on
the
file
server
is
only
used
as
a
cache
for
the
contents
of
a
WORM
device.
The
smaller
WORM
jukeboxes
are
no
longer
expensive
(see
ebay.com
for
SCSI
MMC
jukeboxes
such
as
the
HP
80EX),
and
most
people
can
afford
one.
There
is
an
option
to
use
all
or
part
of
a
magnetic
disk
as
a
``pseudo
worm,''
which
still
provides
one
with
the
ability
to
use
the
file
server's
builtin
backup
capabilities
(described
in
the
file
server
paper
by
Ken
Thompson).
This
document
will
only
cover
this
configuration.
</p>

<p class='para'>

When
the
fs
documentation
says
"WORM",
it
generally

sadly
)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
the
file
server
supports
a
different
set
of
devices
than
the
``normal''
kernel.
SCSI
or
IDE
disks
can
be
used
to
hold
the
file
system.
There
are
significantly
fewer
drivers
available
for
a
file
server.
Just
23
.c
files
in
the
/sys/src/fs/pc
source
code
directory
should
serve
as
a
warning.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Relatively
few
SCSI
controllers
are
supported.
The
only
ones
still
being
manufactured
are
those
from
LSI
Logic
(containing
SCSI
chips
with
model
numbers
of
53C8xx
or
53C1010).
Finally,
the
restrictions
on
VGA
controllers
for
the
normal
kernel
are
rather
more
lenient
for
the
file
server.
This
is
because
the
file
server
doesn't
attempt
to
take
advantage
of
the
display
for
anything
other
than
a
very
basic
(CGA
mode)
console.
</p>

<p class='para'>
(
Its
relatively
important
to
note,
the
NCR/SYM/LSI
driver
only
supports
SCSI
cards
that
implements
the
SCRIPTS
interface
-
using
older
cards,
such
as
the
NCR
53c810
(non-A)
and

will
result
in
crashes/panics

</p>

<p class='para'>
Once
a
machine
has
been
chosen,
create
a
plan9.ini
file
that
describes
it.
In
particular,
specify
all
entries,
even
those
that
would
otherwise
automatically
be
found
(especially
the
SCSI
and
IDE
controllers;
mine
wasn't
automatically
detected,
though
reading
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/plan9.ini"><i>plan9.ini</i>(8)</a>
led
me
to
believe
that
it
would
be).
Also,
you
might
need
to
explicitly
set
the
nvr=
option
in
plan9.ini,
as
the
syntax
for
specifying
the
NVRAM
location
is
different
between
the
file
server
and
normal
kernels.
However,
no
``monitor''
entry
is
required;
if
one
is
present,
it's
ignored.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Typical
entries
might
look
like
this,
among
others:
<pre>
	ether0=type=i82557
	scsi0=type=ncr53c8xx
	nvr=fd!0!plan9.nvr
	bootfile=fd0!dos!9pcfs
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
(Note
that
the
bootfile
entry
can
use
the
newer
style
syntax
&lt;device&gt;!&lt;partition
name&gt;!&lt;file&gt;
as
opposed
to
the
older
&lt;device&gt;!&lt;partition
number&gt;!&lt;file&gt;.
This
is
because
the
bootfile
entry
is
interpreted
by
9load,
whereas
nvr
is
used
by
the
file
server
kernel).
</p>

<p class='para'>
Once
you
have
a
complete
and
accurate
plan9.ini
file,
the
next
step
is
to
build
a
file
server
kernel
and
put
it,
along
with
the
plan9.ini
file,
onto
a
bootable
floppy.
</p>

<p class='para'>
NOTE:
if
you
get
a
linker
error
that
says
"key_setup:
etherga620reset:
not
defined",
make
sure
to
"replica/pull"
for
the
latest
sources
or
get
the
latest
cd
image.
The
mkfile
has
been
fixed.
An
earlier
version
of
the
mkfile
was
missing
the
etherga620
dependency.
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
create
a
file
server
kernel
for
a
PC,
starting
with
a
standalone
CPU
and
authentication
server,
fetch
the
current
Plan
9
distribution
if
you
aren't
sure
that
yours
is
current,
and
install
it
or
upgrade
to
it.
Then
cd
to
/sys/src/fs/emelie,
edit
9pcfs.c
(notably
FIXEDSIZE
and
localconfinit())
and
dat.h
to
set
RBUFSIZE
(the
block
size),
and
run
mk.
(Alternately,
make
a
copy
of
the
emelie
directory
and
work
in
that.)
The
result
should
be
that
a
new
kernel
is
built
and
placed
into
a
file
called
``9pcfs.''
See
/sys/src/fs/README
and
Thompson's
file
server
paper
for
more
information.
In
a
nutshell,
16KB
blocks
will
be
faster,
but
less
space-efficient
than
4KB
blocks.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
insert
a
blank,
formatted
floppy
into
the
CPU/authentication
server
and
run
<pre>
	pc/bootfloppy /dev/fd0disk /path/to/fs/plan9.ini
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
assuming
that
you're
using
the
first
floppy

in
the
system
and
that
you've
done
a

/dev''
at
some
point
in
the
past.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Once
done,
mount
the
floppy
somewhere
and
copy
9pcfs
to
it.
</p>

<p class='para'>
(
Actually,
you
can
shortcut
the
whole
mess
of
mounting
the

copy
9pcfs
by
using:
<pre>
	pc/bootfloppy /dev/fd0disk /path/to/fs/plan9.ini /path/to/fs/9pcfs
</pre>
which
will
build
the
floppy,
and
copy
over
the
kernel
in
one
hit.
--
kuroneko
)
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
give
an
example
of
the
whole
process,
I
start
from
the
console
of
the
standalone
CPU/auth
server:
<pre>
	cd /usr/cross/sys
	ed plan9.ini
	...
	cd /sys/src/fs/plan9pc
	mk
	(insert floppy disk into drive)
	bind -a '#f' /dev
	pc/bootfloppy /dev/fd0disk /usr/cross/sys/plan9.ini
	a:
	cp 9pcfs /n/a:
	unmount /n/a:
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
The
result
is
a
bootable
floppy
disk
with
a
Plan
9
file
server
kernel
image
on
it,
set
as
the
default
kernel
to
load
at
boot
time.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now,
eject
the
floppy
and
physically
insert
it
into
the
floppy
drive
on
the
file
server
machine,
and
boot
it.
After
a
few
minutes
and
a
few
error
messages,
the
system
should
realize
that
the
NVRAM
checksum
is
incorrect
(which
is
good
because
pc/bootfloppy
initializes
the
NVRAM
file
on
the
floppy
with
a
block's
worth
of
zeros)
and
present
you
with
a
``config:
''
prompt.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You
must
now
configure
the
basic
system
parameters,
including
networking
and
the
filesystem.
This
is
largely
covered
in
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/fsconfig"><i>fsconfig</i>(8)</a>
manual
page,
and
I
won't
go
into
many
details
about
it.
Basically,
you
define
the
service
name
by
which
the
fileserver
identifies
itself
using
the
``service''
command,
the
IP
configuration
using
the
``ip,''
``ipmask,''
and
``ipgw''
commands,
the
IP
address
of
the
authentication
server
via
the
``ipauth''
command,
the
place
to
store
configuration
information
via
the
``config''
command,
filesystem
parameters
via
the
``filsys''
command,
the
dump
device
via
the
``dump''
command,
the
instruction
to
initialize
the
filesystems
via
the
``ream''
command,
and
that's
it.
You'll
probably
want
to
store
your
list
of
configuration
commands
somewhere,
in
case
you
ever
need
to
repeat
them,
though
the
console
command
``printconf''
can
print
all
the
permanent
state
(excluding
commandds
such
``ream'').
</p>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
you
*must*
call
at
least
one
filsystem
``main.''
Note
also
that
when
in
config
mode,
the
commands
you
type
don't
actually
do
anything
except
record
actions
to
be
taken
once
you
leave
config
mode.
To
get
out
and
actually
do
what
you've
specified,
type
``end''.
If
you
make
a
mistake,
you
can
safely
reboot
the
machine
and
start
over
before
typing
``end''.
Finally,
the
``config''
command
steals
a
block
from
a
device
and
stashes
configuration
information
in
it.
However,
if
that
block
is
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
device
(and
remember
that
a
device
can
be
a
partition
in
this
context),
then
it
will
be
safe
since
the
filesystem
doesn't
use
the
first
block.
</p>

<p class='para'>
As
an
example,
here
are
the
commands
I
typed
to
configure
my
file
server,
which
uses
an
IDE
disk
as
a
``pseudo-worm,''
and
a
SCSI
disk
as
the
cache:
<pre>
	service lance
	ip 192.168.2.12
	ipgw 192.168.2.1
	ipmask 255.255.255.0
	ipauth 192.168.2.11
	config w0
	filsys main cw0fh0
	filsys dump o
	ream main
	end
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
The
file
server
will
now
initialize
the
disks
and
bring
itself
up.
If
the
system
dies,
it's
probably
due
to
an
incorrect
specification
of
hardware
either
in
plan9.ini
or
during
configuration.
In
particular,
the
system
will
panic
if
it
can't
find
the
disks.
Make
sure
that
your
configuration
is
correct
and
try
again.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
have
some
extra
mag
disk,
you
may
also
want
to
create
an
``other''
filsys
on
the
file
server,
to
store
things
without
consuming
WORM
space.
I
use
this
for
archives
that
I've
copied
from
elsewhere
on
the
web,
and
thus
could
recreate
if
necessary,
but
need
to
store
locally,
at
least
temporarily.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Once
up,
set
up
the
parameters
that
the
system
will
use
for
authentication
by
typing
the
``passwd''
command.
This
should
ask
for
a
password,
authentication
ID,
and
authentication
domain.
These
should
all
be
the
same
as
what
you
used
when
setting
up
the
standalone
CPU/authentication
server.
Executing
this
command
will
also
write
the
configuration
information
to
NVRAM
(which
is
usually
a
file
on
the
floppy).
</p>

<p class='para'>
At
this
point,
the
new
fileserver
will
be
in
a
special
administrative
mode
that
allows
connected
clients
to
bypass
normal
permission
checking,
and
will
also
allow
clients
to
modify
the
ownership
of
files
(which
flat
out
isn't
possible
when
the
system
is
running
in
``normal''
mode).
Before
users
can
connect,
however,
the
system
will
authenticate
them
via
the
authentication
server,
and
must
know
what
users
exist
in
order
to
do
so.
We
now
have
a
chicken
and
egg
problem;
the
system
wants
to
authenticate
users,
but
doesn't
have
an
/adm/users
for
it
to
be
able
to
know
what
users
exist
to
try
and
authenticate.
However,
we
can't
yet
mount
the
new
file
server
to
add
an
/adm/users.
Luckily,
we
can
type
a
command,
``users
default''
to
create
a
basic
set
of
users
sufficient
for
installing
the
system
onto
the
new
machine.
Type
this
now:
<pre>
	users default
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
go
back
to
the
standalone
machine
CPU/auth
server,
mount
the
new
file
server,
and
load
the
distribution
onto
it.
Note
that
when
you
installed
the
standalone
CPU/auth
server,
you
downloaded
the
distribution
to
your
local
disk,
and
it
is
in
the
directory
/dist.
One
uses
wrap/inst
with
the
-ovr
(set
ownership,
verbose,
root
to
install
to
as
next
argument)
to
load
the
distribution
onto
the
new
file
server.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
if
your
CPU/auth
server
boots
using
the
key
of
a
user
who
does
not
exist
by
default
(say
``tom'')
you
will
need
to
create
that
user
via
the
``newuser''
command
before
loading
the
distribution:
<pre>
	 newuser tom
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
(Even
if
the
file
server
cannot
yet
write
to
/adm/users,
newuser
appears
to
create
a
new
user
in
its
internal
table.
I
had
to
edit
/adm/users
later
to
bring
things
back

(What
I
Did
-
I've
got
a

I
took
my

from

<pre>
	config: service kremvax

</p>

<p class='para'>
(reboot)

and
now
I've

Assuming
you
use
the
same
setup
I
did
earlier,
type
the
following
at
the
standalone
CPU/auth
server
console:
<pre>
	srv il!lance
	mount -c /srv/il!lance /n/lance
	cd /dist
	wrap/inst -ovr /n/lance plan9.9gz
	#(use wrap/inst for any other packages, e.g., tex)
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
I've
found
that
this
doesn't
take
too
long
on
a
modern
machine
with
a
fast
Ethernet
and
fast
disks.
My
file
server
is
a
550MHz
Pentium
III
with
256MB
RAM,
an
SYM53C875
SCSI
controller,
a
9GB
SCSI
disk
holding
``main,''
and
an
Intel
82557
fast
Ethernet
controller.
Installing
the
base
distribution
from
a
dual
processor
733MHz
Pentium
III
with
512MB
RAM,
a
3com
3c905
Ethernet
controller
and
IDE
disks
over
a
Baystack
450-24T
switch
takes
about
15
minutes
or
so.
</p>

<p class='para'>
(It
also
only
took
15
minutes
for
another
9'er
with
a
333MHz
Pentium
II
CPU
server
and
a
233MHz
Pentium
MMX
fileserver,
each
with
128MB
RAM,
over
fast
Ethernet.
Stuffing
a
100Mbps
pipe
doesn't
take
much
grunt.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Anyway,
once
the
distribution
and
any
additional
software
you're
interested
in
is
installed,
you
customize
a
few
files
on
the
file
server
before
you
reboot.
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
particular,
rc/bin/cpurc,
rc/bin/termrc,
and
lib/ndb/local
are
good
candidates
for
customization:
<pre>
	cd /n/lance/rc/bin
	ed termrc
	#...
	ed cpurc
	#...
	cd /n/lance/lib/ndb
	ed local
	#...
	#(edit any other files you feel are pertinent)
	unmount /n/lance
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
See
the
``Getting
Started
with
Plan
9''
document
for
more
information.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Once
the
system
is
installed
and
administrative
files
have
been
customized,
you
add
new
users
via
the
``newuser''
command
on
the
file
server
console.
See
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/fs"><i>fs</i>(8)</a>
for
more
information
on
the
particulars
of
user
and
group
management.
Note
that
when
you
create
a
user,
you
should
also
create
its
mailbox
using
the
``create''
command.
</p>

<p class='para'>
An
example
of
creating
a
user
might
be:
<pre>
	newuser cross
	newuser sys +cross
	create /mail/box/cross cross upas 775 d
	create /mail/box/cross/mbox cross upas 662 al
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
The
first
command
creates
a
user
called
cross,
and
adds
him
to
/adm/users.
Next,
it
adds
cross
to
the
group
sys.
Finally,
it
creates
cross's
mailbox
(see
also
the
-c
option
of
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/mail"><i>mail</i>(1)</a>
).
See
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/fs"><i>fs</i>(8)</a>
for
more
information.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
you're
basically
done.
Either
continue
to
play
with
the
file
server
while
in
the
administrative
mode
where
you
can
bypass
access
permissions,
or
reboot
it
immediately
via
the
``halt''
command
to
enable
normal
access
checking:
<pre>
	halt
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
The
system
should
boot
off
of
the
floppy
and
come
up
into
``normal''
mode,
which
permission
bypassing
disallowed.
Congratulations,
your
file
server
is
now
fully
set
up!
</p>

<p class='para'>
Should
you
need
to
re-enable
bypassing
of
access
checks
for
whatever
reason
at
some
point
in
the
future,
you
can
do
so
by
re-entering
config
mode
when
the
machine
boots
and
typing
the
``allow''
command
followed
by
``end''.
The
system
will
prompt
you
with
``type
a
key
within
the
next
5
seconds
to
enter
configuration
mode'';
this
is
how
you
re-enter
config
mode.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If,
now
that
you
have
a
file
server,
you
want
to
make
your
CPU/auth
server
diskless,
i.e.,
make
it
boot
from
the
file
server,
you
can
do
so
by
using
a
boot
floppy
with
a
plan9.ini
and
a
kernel
for
the
CPU
server.
(You
can
of
course
use
your
hard
disk
to
keep
both
files
there).
Here
is
the
plan9.ini
I
use
to
boot
my
diskless
CPU/auth
server:
<pre>
bootfile=sdC0!9fat!9pcdisk
bootargs=il -g 212.128.4.1 ether /net/ether0 212.128.4.205 255.255.255.0
fs=212.128.4.206
auth=212.128.4.205
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
As
you
can
see,
you
can
use
bootargs
to
configure
your
gateway,
ip
address,
and
ip
mask;
fs
for
the
ip
address
of
your
file
server;
and
auth
for
the
ip
address
of
your
auth
server.
In
the
example,
the
last
IP
address
is
the
one
for
the
CPU/auth
server
using
the
plan9.ini
shown.
</p>

<p class='para'>
mike@plan9os.org:
After
I
got
my
auth
server
booting
diskless,
auth/changeuser
wouldn't
work
because
bootes
didn't
have
write
access
to
/adm/keys*
or
/adm/netkeys*.
I
had
to
delete
these
files
and
(they
were
of
zero
size
anyway)
and
recreate
them
on
the
file
server
console
like
so:
<pre>
remove /adm/keys
remove /adm/keys.who
remove /adm/netkeys
remove /adm/netkeys.who
create /adm/keys bootes adm 660
create /adm/keys.who bootes adm 660
create /adm/netkeys bootes adm 660
create /adm/netkeys.who bootes adm 660
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
I'm
not
sure
if
this
is
good
policy,
but
it
worked.
