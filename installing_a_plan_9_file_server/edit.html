INSTALLING A CURRENT PLAN 9 4TH EDITION FILE SERVER

Installing a Plan 9 file server can be a bewildering experience for a
new user. This document is intended to take some of the guesswork out
of it. Also read [Upgrading to fourth edition] for some important
fourth edition details.

When installing a Plan 9 network, the file server should be one of
the first machines set up, immediately after a standalone
CPU/authentication server. The installation is fairly easy once one
knows the steps to follow and understands what is happening.

This information is cribbed from many other sources, including
several manual pages, installation instructions from the 2nd edition
(found online), the paper by Ken Thompson on the Plan 9 File Server,
notes from the 9fans@cse.psu.edu archives, and reading the code in
/sys/src/fs.

Folks who are curious about the file server are encouraged to read
any available reference material. In particular, read the manual
pages fs(4), fs(8), and fsconfig(8). Also, the paper ``The Plan 9
File Server,'' by Ken Thompson (available in Volume 2 of the manual,
or via ``page /sys/doc/fs/fs.ps'') is illuminating. Further, the
``Installing the Plan 9 Distribution'' document from the second
edition can fill in a few of the holes, and can be found at
[ftp://ftp.dbsystems.com/pub/plan9/install.html]. This wiki provides
post-setup installation that can be handy. See the main [plan 9 wiki]
page. Finally, the 9fans archives, available on the web at
[http://lists.cse.psu.edu/archives/9fans/] have quite a bit of
collected wisdom in them, and are well worth a read when you run into
a snag. Broadly outlined, the steps for file server installation are
as follows:
 *	creating a plan9.ini(8) file describing the file server hardware
 *	creating a boot floppy with a file server kernel
 *	setting network parameters and initializing the filesystem on disk
 *	setting authentication information in nvram or on the floppy
 *	populating the server with data and user information
 *	rebooting to come up in ``normal'' mode

To begin, pick a machine on the network that is going to be the Plan
9 file server. This machine will run a specialized kernel, and will
be dedicated to serving files. It cannot, for instance, double as a
CPU or authentication server. In normal usage at Bell Labs, magnetic
disk on the file server is only used as a cache for the contents of a
WORM device. The smaller WORM jukeboxes are no longer expensive (see
ebay.com for SCSI MMC jukeboxes such as the HP 80EX), and most people
can afford one. There is an option to use all or part of a magnetic
disk as a ``pseudo worm,'' which still provides one with the ability
to use the file server's builtin backup capabilities (described in
the file server paper by Ken Thompson). This document will only cover
this configuration.

( When the fs documentation says "WORM", it generally applies to any
MO cartridge system, be it using WORM or MO Rewritables -- kuroneko )

(I found 80EXs for $300 on ebay 9 Nov 2002 and also brand new 80EXs
[here |
http://www.codemicro.com/store/prod_results.cfm?mode=5&srchparm=C1100J#ABA] for $6,007.75 but none in the uk sadly )

Note that the file server supports a different set of devices than
the ``normal'' kernel. SCSI or IDE disks can be used to hold the file
system. There are significantly fewer drivers available for a file
server. Just 23 .c files in the /sys/src/fs/pc source code directory
should serve as a warning.

Relatively few SCSI controllers are supported. The only ones still
being manufactured are those from LSI Logic (containing SCSI chips
with model numbers of 53C8xx or 53C1010). Finally, the restrictions
on VGA controllers for the normal kernel are rather more lenient for
the file server. This is because the file server doesn't attempt to
take advantage of the display for anything other than a very basic
(CGA mode) console.

( Its relatively important to note, the NCR/SYM/LSI driver only
supports SCSI cards that implements the SCRIPTS interface - using
older cards, such as the NCR 53c810 (non-A) and 825 will result in
crashes/panics -- kuroneko )

Once a machine has been chosen, create a plan9.ini file that
describes it. In particular, specify all entries, even those that
would otherwise automatically be found (especially the SCSI and IDE
controllers; mine wasn't automatically detected, though reading
plan9.ini(8) led me to believe that it would be). Also, you might
need to explicitly set the nvr= option in plan9.ini, as the syntax
for specifying the NVRAM location is different between the file
server and normal kernels. However, no ``monitor'' entry is required;
if one is present, it's ignored.

Typical entries might look like this, among others:
! 	ether0=type=i82557
! 	scsi0=type=ncr53c8xx
! 	nvr=fd!0!plan9.nvr
! 	bootfile=fd0!dos!9pcfs

(Note that the bootfile entry can use the newer style syntax
<device>!<partition name>!<file> as opposed to the older
<device>!<partition number>!<file>. This is because the bootfile
entry is interpreted by 9load, whereas nvr is used by the file server
kernel).

Once you have a complete and accurate plan9.ini file, the next step
is to build a file server kernel and put it, along with the plan9.ini
file, onto a bootable floppy.

NOTE: if you get a linker error that says "key_setup:
etherga620reset: not defined", make sure to "replica/pull" for the
latest sources or get the latest cd image. The mkfile has been fixed.
An earlier version of the mkfile was missing the etherga620
dependency.

To create a file server kernel for a PC, starting with a standalone
CPU and authentication server, fetch the current Plan 9 distribution
if you aren't sure that yours is current, and install it or upgrade
to it. Then cd to /sys/src/fs/emelie, edit 9pcfs.c (notably FIXEDSIZE
and localconfinit()) and dat.h to set RBUFSIZE (the block size), and
run mk. (Alternately, make a copy of the emelie directory and work in
that.) The result should be that a new kernel is built and placed
into a file called ``9pcfs.'' See /sys/src/fs/README and Thompson's
file server paper for more information. In a nutshell, 16KB blocks
will be faster, but less space-efficient than 4KB blocks.

Now insert a blank, formatted floppy into the CPU/authentication
server and run
! 	pc/bootfloppy /dev/fd0disk /path/to/fs/plan9.ini

assuming that you're using the first floppy disk in the system and
that you've done a ``bind -a '#f' /dev'' at some point in the past.

Once done, mount the floppy somewhere and copy 9pcfs to it.

( Actually, you can shortcut the whole mess of mounting the floppy to
copy 9pcfs by using:
! 	pc/bootfloppy /dev/fd0disk /path/to/fs/plan9.ini /path/to/fs/9pcfs
which will build the floppy, and copy over the kernel in one hit. --
kuroneko )

To give an example of the whole process, I start from the console of
the standalone CPU/auth server:
! 	cd /usr/cross/sys
! 	ed plan9.ini
! 	...
! 	cd /sys/src/fs/plan9pc
! 	mk
! 	(insert floppy disk into drive)
! 	bind -a '#f' /dev
! 	pc/bootfloppy /dev/fd0disk /usr/cross/sys/plan9.ini
! 	a:
! 	cp 9pcfs /n/a:
! 	unmount /n/a:

The result is a bootable floppy disk with a Plan 9 file server kernel
image on it, set as the default kernel to load at boot time.

Now, eject the floppy and physically insert it into the floppy drive
on the file server machine, and boot it. After a few minutes and a
few error messages, the system should realize that the NVRAM checksum
is incorrect (which is good because pc/bootfloppy initializes the
NVRAM file on the floppy with a block's worth of zeros) and present
you with a ``config: '' prompt.

You must now configure the basic system parameters, including
networking and the filesystem. This is largely covered in the
fsconfig(8) manual page, and I won't go into many details about it.
Basically, you define the service name by which the fileserver
identifies itself using the ``service'' command, the IP configuration
using the ``ip,'' ``ipmask,'' and ``ipgw'' commands, the IP address
of the authentication server via the ``ipauth'' command, the place to
store configuration information via the ``config'' command,
filesystem parameters via the ``filsys'' command, the dump device via
the ``dump'' command, the instruction to initialize the filesystems
via the ``ream'' command, and that's it. You'll probably want to
store your list of configuration commands somewhere, in case you ever
need to repeat them, though the console command ``printconf'' can
print all the permanent state (excluding commandds such ``ream'').

Note that you *must* call at least one filsystem ``main.'' Note also
that when in config mode, the commands you type don't actually do
anything except record actions to be taken once you leave config
mode. To get out and actually do what you've specified, type ``end''.
If you make a mistake, you can safely reboot the machine and start
over before typing ``end''. Finally, the ``config'' command steals a
block from a device and stashes configuration information in it.
However, if that block is at the very beginning of the device (and
remember that a device can be a partition in this context), then it
will be safe since the filesystem doesn't use the first block.

As an example, here are the commands I typed to configure my file
server, which uses an IDE disk as a ``pseudo-worm,'' and a SCSI disk
as the cache:
! 	service lance
! 	ip 192.168.2.12
! 	ipgw 192.168.2.1
! 	ipmask 255.255.255.0
! 	ipauth 192.168.2.11
! 	config w0
! 	filsys main cw0fh0
! 	filsys dump o
! 	ream main
! 	end

The file server will now initialize the disks and bring itself up. If
the system dies, it's probably due to an incorrect specification of
hardware either in plan9.ini or during configuration. In particular,
the system will panic if it can't find the disks. Make sure that your
configuration is correct and try again.

If you have some extra mag disk, you may also want to create an
``other'' filsys on the file server, to store things without
consuming WORM space. I use this for archives that I've copied from
elsewhere on the web, and thus could recreate if necessary, but need
to store locally, at least temporarily.

Once up, set up the parameters that the system will use for
authentication by typing the ``passwd'' command. This should ask for
a password, authentication ID, and authentication domain. These
should all be the same as what you used when setting up the
standalone CPU/authentication server. Executing this command will
also write the configuration information to NVRAM (which is usually a
file on the floppy).

At this point, the new fileserver will be in a special administrative
mode that allows connected clients to bypass normal permission
checking, and will also allow clients to modify the ownership of
files (which flat out isn't possible when the system is running in
``normal'' mode). Before users can connect, however, the system will
authenticate them via the authentication server, and must know what
users exist in order to do so. We now have a chicken and egg problem;
the system wants to authenticate users, but doesn't have an
/adm/users for it to be able to know what users exist to try and
authenticate. However, we can't yet mount the new file server to add
an /adm/users. Luckily, we can type a command, ``users default'' to
create a basic set of users sufficient for installing the system onto
the new machine. Type this now:
! 	users default

Now go back to the standalone machine CPU/auth server, mount the new
file server, and load the distribution onto it. Note that when you
installed the standalone CPU/auth server, you downloaded the
distribution to your local disk, and it is in the directory /dist.
One uses wrap/inst with the -ovr (set ownership, verbose, root to
install to as next argument) to load the distribution onto the new
file server.

Note that if your CPU/auth server boots using the key of a user who
does not exist by default (say ``tom'') you will need to create that
user via the ``newuser'' command before loading the distribution:
! 	 newuser tom

(Even if the file server cannot yet write to /adm/users, newuser
appears to create a new user in its internal table. I had to edit
/adm/users later to bring things back into sync. [plus@cosym.net])

(What I Did - I've got a SCSI disk: I took my partition suggestion
from fsconfig(8):
! 	config: service kremvax
! 	config: config p(w0)50.1
! 	config: filsys main cp(w0)50.25f[p(w0)0.25p(w0)25.25p(w0)75.25]
! 	config: filsys dump o
! 	config: ream main config: ip 192.168.1.9
! 	config: ipgw 192.168.1.1
! 	config: ipauth 192.168.1.109
! 	config: ipmask 255.255.255.0
! 	config: end

! 	kremvax: create /adm -1 -1 775 d
! 	kremvax: create /adm/users -1 -1 664
! 	kremvax: create /usr 10000 10000 755 d
! 	kremvax: halt

(reboot)
! 	config: allow
! 	config: end

then with drawterm
! 	cpu% 9fs kremvax
! 	cpu% acme /n/kremvax/adm/users

then copied over the default kfs version
! 	kremvax: adduser matt
! 	kremvax: halt

(reboot)

and now I've got a writeable by only matt /usr/matt dir on the file
server.)

THOSE PARENTHESISED INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRONG.

See [Upgrading to fourth edition].

Assuming you use the same setup I did earlier, type the following at
the standalone CPU/auth server console:
! 	srv il!lance
! 	mount -c /srv/il!lance /n/lance
! 	cd /dist
! 	wrap/inst -ovr /n/lance plan9.9gz
! 	#(use wrap/inst for any other packages, e.g., tex)

I've found that this doesn't take too long on a modern machine with a
fast Ethernet and fast disks. My file server is a 550MHz Pentium III
with 256MB RAM, an SYM53C875 SCSI controller, a 9GB SCSI disk holding
``main,'' and an Intel 82557 fast Ethernet controller. Installing the
base distribution from a dual processor 733MHz Pentium III with 512MB
RAM, a 3com 3c905 Ethernet controller and IDE disks over a Baystack
450-24T switch takes about 15 minutes or so.

(It also only took 15 minutes for another 9'er with a 333MHz Pentium
II CPU server and a 233MHz Pentium MMX fileserver, each with 128MB
RAM, over fast Ethernet. Stuffing a 100Mbps pipe doesn't take much
grunt.)

Anyway, once the distribution and any additional software you're
interested in is installed, you customize a few files on the file
server before you reboot.

In particular, rc/bin/cpurc, rc/bin/termrc, and lib/ndb/local are
good candidates for customization:
! 	cd /n/lance/rc/bin
! 	ed termrc
! 	#...
! 	ed cpurc
! 	#...
! 	cd /n/lance/lib/ndb
! 	ed local
! 	#...
! 	#(edit any other files you feel are pertinent)
! 	unmount /n/lance

See the ``Getting Started with Plan 9'' document for more information.

Once the system is installed and administrative files have been
customized, you add new users via the ``newuser'' command on the file
server console. See fs(8) for more information on the particulars of
user and group management. Note that when you create a user, you
should also create its mailbox using the ``create'' command.

An example of creating a user might be:
! 	newuser cross
! 	newuser sys +cross
! 	create /mail/box/cross cross upas 775 d
! 	create /mail/box/cross/mbox cross upas 662 al

The first command creates a user called cross, and adds him to
/adm/users. Next, it adds cross to the group sys. Finally, it creates
cross's mailbox (see also the -c option of mail(1) ). See fs(8) for
more information.

Now you're basically done. Either continue to play with the file
server while in the administrative mode where you can bypass access
permissions, or reboot it immediately via the ``halt'' command to
enable normal access checking:
! 	halt

The system should boot off of the floppy and come up into ``normal''
mode, which permission bypassing disallowed. Congratulations, your
file server is now fully set up!

Should you need to re-enable bypassing of access checks for whatever
reason at some point in the future, you can do so by re-entering
config mode when the machine boots and typing the ``allow'' command
followed by ``end''. The system will prompt you with ``type a key
within the next 5 seconds to enter configuration mode''; this is how
you re-enter config mode.

If, now that you have a file server, you want to make your CPU/auth
server diskless, i.e., make it boot from the file server, you can do
so by using a boot floppy with a plan9.ini and a kernel for the CPU
server. (You can of course use your hard disk to keep both files
there). Here is the plan9.ini I use to boot my diskless CPU/auth
server:
! bootfile=sdC0!9fat!9pcdisk
! bootargs=il -g 212.128.4.1 ether /net/ether0 212.128.4.205 255.255.255.0
! fs=212.128.4.206
! auth=212.128.4.205

As you can see, you can use bootargs to configure your gateway, ip
address, and ip mask; fs for the ip address of your file server; and
auth for the ip address of your auth server. In the example, the last
IP address is the one for the CPU/auth server using the plan9.ini
shown.

mike@plan9os.org: After I got my auth server booting diskless,
auth/changeuser wouldn't work because bootes didn't have write access
to /adm/keys* or /adm/netkeys*. I had to delete these files and (they
were of zero size anyway) and recreate them on the file server
console like so:
! remove /adm/keys
! remove /adm/keys.who
! remove /adm/netkeys
! remove /adm/netkeys.who
! create /adm/keys bootes adm 660
! create /adm/keys.who bootes adm 660
! create /adm/netkeys bootes adm 660
! create /adm/netkeys.who bootes adm 660

I'm not sure if this is good policy, but it worked.
