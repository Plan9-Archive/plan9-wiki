Using acme</h1>

<div class='body'> <!-- ***************************** -->

<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/acme"><i>acme</i>(1)</a>
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/sam"><i>sam</i>(1)</a>
are
the
editors
you
are
likely
to
use
in
Plan
9.
In
fact,
acme
is
much
more
than
an
editor.
It
is
a
complete
environment
you
can
use
to
edit,
run
programs,
browse
the
file
system,
etc.
<p class='para'>
You
should
read
the
paper
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/acme/">Acme:
A
User
Interface
for
Programmers</a>,
which
is
in
your
file
system
as
/sys/doc/acme/acme.ps
if
you
are
using
Plan
9.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You
can
also
find
more
info
in
the
unoficial
<a href="http://acme.cat-v.org">Acme</a>
website.
</p>

<p class='para'>
When
you
start
Acme,
you
see
several
windows
layered
into
two
columns.
Above
each
window,
you
can
see
a
"tag
line"
(in
blue).
The
first
thing
to
notice
is
that
all
the
text
you
see
is
just
that:
text.
You
can
edit
anything
at
will.
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
take
an
example,
Acme
usually
displays
the
contents
of
the
directory
where
it
was
started.
Create
a
new
window
and
start
Acme
on
it.
Now,
assuming
you
started
Acme
while
your
current
directory
was
/usr/glenda,
you
can
see
a
window
with
contents
</p>

<pre>
bin/ lib/ tmp/
</pre>

<p class='para'>
The
"contents"
is
called
"body"
in
Acme.
If
you
look
at
the
window's
tag
line,
you
will
see
that
it
contains
</p>

<pre>
/usr/glenda/ Del Snarf Get | Look 
</pre>

<p class='para'>
That
is
just
text.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Each
mouse
button
(1,
2,
3,
from
left
to
right)
does
a
different
thing
in
Acme:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Button
1
can
be
used
to
select
text
(press
it,
sweep,
release
it),
and
also
to
select
the
point
where
text
would
be
inserted
in
the
window.
Use
it
now
in
your
/usr/glenda
window.
</li>

<li>
Button
2
can
be
used
to
execute
things.
For
example,
use
button
1
to
type
"ls
-l"
before
"lib/"
in
the
window
showing
/usr/glenda.
Now
use
button
2
to
select
"ls
-l
lib/"
(you
know,
press
it,
select,
release
it).
As
you
can
see,
button
2
means
"execute
this".
</li>

<li>
Button
3
can
be
used
to
get
things.
For
example,
click
button
3
on
"lib/"
within
the
"/usr/glenda"
window.
Can
you
see
how
a
new
window
shows
the
contents
of
"/usr/glenda/lib"?
Button
3
can
also
be
used
to
search
within
the
body
of
a
window.
Just
click
button
3
on
the
thing
you
want
to
search.
Again,
you
can
select
something
with
button
1
and
then
use
button
3
on
the
selection.
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
You
should
know
that
you
can
use
double-click
with
button
1
to
select
words
(a
double
click
near
the
end/beginning
of
a
line
would
select
the
whole
line).
Besides,
once
you
have
text
selected,
you
can
simply
click
on
it
with
button
2
to
execute
the
selected
text.
A
single
click
of
button
2
would
execute
the
word
clicked
as
a
command.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Now
let's
pay
attention
to
the
tag
line
once
more.
As
you
can
see,
the
left
part
has
a
path.
That
is
the
name
for
the
window
and
shows
also
the
directory
for
the
thing
shown
(file/directory/program
output).
When
you
execute
something
using
button
2,
the
current
directory
for
the
command
is
the
directory
shown
in
the
left
part
of
the
tag
(if
the
thing
shown
is
a
file,
its
directory
is
used).
</p>

<p class='para'>
As
you
saw
before
in
the
example,
there
are
windows
labeled
"/dir/+Errors",
that
is
where
Acme
shows
the
output
of
a
command
executed
in
"/dir".
</p>

<p class='para'>
Another
thing
you
can
see
is
that
tag
lines
contain
words
like
"New",
"Del",
"Snarf",
etc.
Those
are
commands
understood
(implemented)
by
Acme.
When
you
request
execution
of
one
of
them,
Acme
does
the
job.
For
example,
click
with
button
2
on
"Del"
in
the
"/usr/glenda/+Errors"
window:
it's
gone.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
commands
shown
by
Acme
are
just
text
and
by
no
means
special.
Try
to
type
"Del"
within
the
body
of
the
window
"/usr/glenda",
and
then
click
(button-2)
on
it.
</p>

<p class='para'>
These
are
some
commands
understood
by
Acme:
<ul>

<li>
Newcol:
create
a
new
column
of
windows
</li>

<li>
Delcol:
delete
a
column
</li>

<li>
New:
create
a
new
window
(edit
its
tag
to
be
a
file
name
and
you
would
be
creating
a
new
file;
you
would
need
to
click
on
"Put"
to
put
the
file
in
the
file
system).
</li>

<li>
Put:
write
the
body
to
disk.
The
file
is
the
one
named
in
the
tag.
</li>

<li>
Get:
refresh
the
body
(e.g.
if
it's
a
directory,
reread
it
and
show
it).
</li>

<li>
Snarf:
What
other
window
systems
call
"Copy".
</li>

<li>
Paste:
Can
you
guess
it?
</li>

<li>
Exit:
exit
acme
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p class='para'>
Acme
likes
to
place
new
windows
itself.
If
you
prefer
to
change
the
layout
of
a
window,
you
only
need
to
drag
the
layout
box
at
the
left
of
the
tag
line
and
drop
it
somewhere
else.
The
point
where
you
drop
it
selects
the
column
where
the
window
is
to
be
placed
now,
as
well
as
the
line
where
the
window
should
start.
You
can
also
click
the
layout
box
to
enlarge
its
window
a
small
amount
(button
1),
as
much
as
possible
without
obscuring
other
tag
lines
in
the
column
(button
2),
and
to
fill
the
whole
column
(button
3).
You
can
get
your
other
windows
back
by
button-1-
or
button-2-clicking
the
layout
box.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Acme
allows
you
send
output
and
take
input
from
other
programs.
One
of
the
most
common
applications
of
this
is
using
commands
like
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/sed"><i>sed</i>(1)</a>
to
edit
your
text.
If
you
wish
to
change
"foo"
to
"bar"
in
a
section
of
text
in
acme,
you
add
the
following
pipe
command
to
the
tag
bar
of
the
acme
window
wou
wish
to
modify.
</p>

<pre>
| sed 's/foo/bar/g'
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Note
the
|
operator.
Now
you
can
use
mouse
button
1
to
select
a
section
of
text
by
highlighting
it.
Now
use
button
1
again
to
highlight
the
entire
command
shown
above
(including
the
pipe
operator).
This
highlight
appears
in
blue.
Now
button
2
click
on
the
blue
highlighted
command,
and
it
will
be
applied
to
the
selected
text
in
the
window
below.
Some
common
utilities
to
pipe
to/from
are
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/sed"><i>sed</i>(1)</a>,
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/grep"><i>grep</i>(1)</a>,
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/tr"><i>tr</i>(1)</a>,
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/sort"><i>sort</i>(1)</a>.
</p>

<p class='para'>
This
is
mostly
what
you
need
to
get
started
with
Acme.
You
are
missing
a
very
useful
feature:
using
combinations
(chords)
of
mouse
buttons
to
do
things.
You
can
cut,
paste,
snarf,
and
pass
arguments
to
programs
using
these
mouse
chords.
You
can
read
this
in
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/acme"><i>acme</i>(1)</a>
manual
page,
but
it's
actually
extremely
simple:
Select
a
region
with
button
1
but
don't
release
the
button.
Now
clicking
button
2
deletes
the
selected
text
(putting
it
into
the
snarf
buffer);
clicking
button
3
replaces
the
selected
text
with
the
snarf
buffer.
That's
it!
