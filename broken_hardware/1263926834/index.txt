Broken Hardware

This page lists hardware known to NOT work with Plan 9.

Entries here should note the reason for the incompatibility and
include a datestamp. Please be as specific as possible about part,
model, and revision numbers, including firmware and BIOS versions
when relevant.

Don't mention hardware for which there is obviously no driver
support; this list is intended to enumerate broken hardware that you
would have expected to work ...

MOTHERBOARDS

 *	Intel D945GCLF2: Very broken ACPI implementation. Fails to boot
	the Plan 9 loader; seriously hosed under FreeBSD as well.
	(2009-12-30 lyndon@orthanc.ca)
 *	Intel DG45ID: ACPI-only, no MP tables, so only one core will be
	seen. (15 Jan 2010 geoff@plan9.bell-labs.com)
 *	Intel DG45MJ: built-in Ethernet is Realtek and doesn't PXE boot
	correctly. (19 Jan 2010 geoff@plan9.bell-labs.com)
