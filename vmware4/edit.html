The VMware 4 disk image is now sorely outdated and is no longer
distributed. You can install into a VMware4 virtual machine using the
install CD just like on a real computer.

Here are some tips on [dual booting bare machine and vmware] using
the same physical disk for both, while avoiding a couple of pitfalls.

Problems and work-arounds:
 *	There is a problem with the CDROM in VMWare 4.5. If you boot Plan9
	with a CDROM device attached to your virtual machine 9Load will hang
	unless a CDROM is present ("connected"). If you don't need CDROM
	support it is recommended that you remove the CDROM device from your
	virtual machine. If you need this device, make sure to keep a CD
	image attached.

 *	Problem with 9load hanging when booting in VMWare can be avoided
	if you move the CD-ROM drive to the SCSI bus. VMWare allows SCSI
	simulation for ATA CD-ROM drives: just select appropriate radio
	button in the cd-rom settings dialog. SCSI controller (BT-958) is
	supported by Plan 9. In this case use /dev/sd00 for access to CDROM
	drive.

 *	There is a problem using more than two buttons on an IBM Thinkpad.
	Russ Cox described a workaround on 9fans:

! 
! Two things.  First, go into Control Panel -> Mouse -> Trackpoint
! and make sure that the middle button setting is "neither" (there
! are three choices: "scrolling", "zooming", and "neither").
! 
! Second, start regedit.  Look for
! 
! 	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
! 	 System
! 	  CurrentControlSet
! 	   Enum
! 	    ACPI
! 	     IBM3780
! 	      <ugly hex>
! 	       DeviceParameters
! 
! You may have to substitute something else for IBM3780 depending
! on who makes your laptop.  Find the one with keys named "MouseResolution",
! "MouseDataQueueSize", etc.  Add a new DWORD variable "NumberOfButtons"
! with value 3.  
! 
! Now you should be okay.
! 
! The problem is actually not the IBM-supplied mouse driver but the
! underlying Windows-supplied basic i8042 PS/2 mouse driver, on which
! the Trackpoint driver sits.
! 
! The Windows driver expects the Trackpoint to respond to command E9
! as the Logitech mice do, giving the number of buttons as the second byte.
! Unfortunately, the Trackpoint sends back some form of sampling resolution
! instead, and even more unfortunately the default resolution is encoded
! as 0x02, tricking Windows into thinking that there are but two mouse
! buttons on the Trackpoint.  Since this is the Trackpoint controller simply
! implementing a different command E9, the only way to get the hardware
! to respond correctly is to turn it off in the BIOS, so that the external
! mouse can respond for itself.
! 
! Happily, Windows is nothing if not configurable.  The registry key makes
! Windows ignore what it has incorrectly interpreted the hardware to have said.
! DirectInput (which VMware uses, but most apps don't) ignores the middle
! button when it thinks the mouse has only two buttons.  The stock Windows 
! mouse path has no problem with a "two"-button mouse generating middle-button
! events.
