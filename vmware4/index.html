The
VMware
4
disk
image
is
now
sorely
outdated
and
is
no
longer
distributed.
You
can
install
into
a
VMware4
virtual
machine
using
the
install
CD
just
like
on
a
real
computer.

Problems

<li>
There
is
a
problem
with
the
CDROM
in
VMWare
4.5.
If

boot
Plan9
with
a

device
attached
to

9Load
will
hang
unless
a
CDROM
is
present
("connected").
If

don't
need

support
it
is
recommended
that
you
remove
the
CDROM
device
from
your

If

make

to
keep

Problem
with
9load
hanging
when
booting
in
VMWare
can
be
avoided
if
you
move
the
CD-ROM
drive
to
the
SCSI
bus.
VMWare
allows
SCSI
simulation
for
ATA
CD-ROM
drives:
just
select
appropriate

button
in
the
cd-rom
settings
dialog.
SCSI
controller
(BT-958)
is
supported
by
Plan

In
this
case
use
/dev/sd00
for
access
to

Two things.  First, go into Control Panel -&gt; Mouse -&gt; Trackpoint
and make sure that the middle button setting is "neither" (there
are three choices: "scrolling", "zooming", and "neither").

Second, start regedit.  Look for

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
	 System
	  CurrentControlSet
	   Enum
	    ACPI
	     IBM3780
	      &lt;ugly hex&gt;
	       DeviceParameters

You may have to substitute something else for IBM3780 depending
on who makes your laptop.  Find the one with keys named "MouseResolution",
"MouseDataQueueSize", etc.  Add a new DWORD variable "NumberOfButtons"
with value 3.  

Now you should be okay.

The problem is actually not the IBM-supplied mouse driver but the
underlying Windows-supplied basic i8042 PS/2 mouse driver, on which
the Trackpoint driver sits.

The Windows driver expects the Trackpoint to respond to command E9
as the Logitech mice do, giving the number of buttons as the second byte.
Unfortunately, the Trackpoint sends back some form of sampling resolution
instead, and even more unfortunately the default resolution is encoded
as 0x02, tricking Windows into thinking that there are but two mouse
buttons on the Trackpoint.  Since this is the Trackpoint controller simply
implementing a different command E9, the only way to get the hardware
to respond correctly is to turn it off in the BIOS, so that the external
mouse can respond for itself.

Happily, Windows is nothing if not configurable.  The registry key makes
Windows ignore what it has incorrectly interpreted the hardware to have said.
DirectInput (which VMware uses, but most apps don't) ignores the middle
button when it thinks the mouse has only two buttons.  The stock Windows 
mouse path has no problem with a "two"-button mouse generating middle-button
events.
