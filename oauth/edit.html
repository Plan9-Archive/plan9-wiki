[OAuth | http://oauth.net] 2.0 is a very common method for users to
provide authorization to web services. To facilitate writing Plan 9
and Inferno clients for many of these services, it would be nice to
teach factotum(4) how to speak OAuth. There are some design
considerations that need to be thought through; the models don't map
directly.

In particular, the most common mode of using OAuth depends on some
browser infrastructure. Is one of the browser options native (or
roughly so) to Plan 9 up to the task? How reliably? Is the structure
of the OAuth landing page standardized?

The first step would be to teach factotum to speak the part of the
protocol that happens after the final hash is acquired. It would be
inconvienent, but users could get that hash through the browser
manually themselve, then hand it to factotum.

The next step would probably be an extension/replacement for
auth/fgui which would look for OAuth requests from factotum and
handle launching a browser (or redirecting an existing one via the
plumber) and handing the results back to factotum.

While it isn't OAuth, [flickrfs |
https://bitbucket.org/bedo/flickrfs] has support for Flickr's
pre-OAuth authentication method, which has some similarities.
Interested students might look to it for reference or inspiration,
particularly for the first half of the problem (as described above).
