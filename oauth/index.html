OAuth</h1>

<div class='body'> <!-- ***************************** -->

<a href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a>
2.0
is
a
very
common
method
for
users
to
provide
authorization
to
web
services.
To
facilitate
writing
Plan
9
and
Inferno
clients
for
many
of
these
services,
it
would
be
nice
to
teach
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/factotum"><i>factotum</i>(4)</a>
how
to
speak
OAuth.
There
are
some
design
considerations
that
need
to
be
thought
through;
the
models
don't
map
directly.
<p class='para'>
In
particular,
the
most
common
mode
of
using
OAuth
depends
on
some
browser
infrastructure.
Is
one
of
the
browser
options
native
(or
roughly
so)
to
Plan
9
up
to
the
task?
How
reliably?
Is
the
structure
of
the
OAuth
landing
page
standardized?
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
first
step
would
be
to
teach
factotum
to
speak
the
part
of
the
protocol
that
happens
after
the
final
hash
is
acquired.
It
would
be
inconvienent,
but
users
could
get
that
hash
through
the
browser
manually
themselve,
then
hand
it
to
factotum.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
next
step
would
probably
be
an
extension/replacement
for
auth/fgui
which
would
look
for
OAuth
requests
from
factotum
and
handle
launching
a
browser
(or
redirecting
an
existing
one
via
the
plumber)
and
handing
the
results
back
to
factotum.
</p>

<p class='para'>
While
it
isn't
OAuth,
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/bedo/flickrfs">flickrfs</a>
has
support
for
Flickr's
pre-OAuth
authentication
method,
which
has
some
similarities.
Interested
students
might
look
to
it
for
reference
or
inspiration,
particularly
for
the
first
half
of
the
problem
(as
described
above).
