Inferno hosted video

Inferno hosted video drivers for Linux. I started looking at this in
the context of OLPC, but it seems like you might be able to do a
hosted gstreamer driver for Inferno and suppot anything gstreamer
does. Although perhaps a lower level of support (direct Video4Linux)
should be considered.

I'm thinking mainly here of supporting web cams but I suppose
extensions could support playback/etc.
