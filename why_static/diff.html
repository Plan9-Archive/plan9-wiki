	gets better. Symbols are now versioned (well, this really happened a few
	years back). So you are very tightly screwed (good word) to the library
	you use, and it covers a definite range forward/backward. I assume but am
	not sure that glibc nowadays encompaesses lots of versions of lots of
	functions going back for years. Which also means the version naming of the
	file (libc-2.3.2.so) has a lot less meaning than it used to. At some
	point, given the tight wiring of an executable to the particular library
	version, one starts to lose track of just why .so's are still thought to
	be a good idea (I mean, on a 1960s-era Burroughs machine with not much
	memory, I get it, but ... /bin/cat on my Redhat box at 20K, is not much
	smaller than /bin/cat on Plan 9 (22K stripped), and the Plan 9 one doesn't
	do symbol fixup every time it runs ...).
	
	And, as Linus mentioned, TLBs matter. Hmm. Judging by 'ps', cat on linux
	needs 256 of them, and cat on Plan 9 needs 6. xclock has got 900 or so, 
	and Plan 9 clock appears to have 3*30 or so (3 clock procs when you run 
	clock). 
	
	So you do pay a bit for .so's. You don't gain an
	implementation-independent interface for your programs, since the .so is
	versioned and the symbols in it are versioned; I wonder what you DO gain?  
	The theory always was you could swap out a shared library and swap in a
	bug-fixed version, which sounds nice until you try it and it fails
	miserably (there was a time when this worked ...)

	&gt; That beeing said I'm the last one to defend glibc's bloat, but in a

	No, it doesn't help much at all. 
	
	Let's take program 'a', which depends on stat. In the new order of gcc,
	when built, 'a' will depend on stat from glib 2.0. A new stat comes along
	with fixes. It gets built into glibc 2.1. You install glibc 2.1. Program
	'a', unless I rebuild or replace it, will be using the old stat. Of
	course, I might think that the shared library has fixed all binaries using
	stat, and I'm wrong -- or am I right? Is the V1 stat just a wrapper? who
	knows? And do you cover all the cases? And maybe it isn't calling stat and
	I don't know it. Maybe it's calling one of these:
	
	000c888c t __GI___fxstat 
	000c90cc t __GI___fxstat64 
	000c90cc t ___fxstat64
	000c888c T __fxstat 
	000c90cc T __fxstat64@@GLIBC_2.2 
	000c90cc T__fxstat64@GLIBC_2.1 
	000c90cc t __old__fxstat64 
	000c888c t _fxstat 
	
	I've found programs that call all these variants, because the functions
	they call call different library functions. It's quite interesting to see.  
	Which one is 'a' calling? Oh yeah, you can max out the ld.so debug
	options, because of course weak symbols come into this game too, and
	you're not really sure unless you watch this:
	
	     19595:     binding file /lib/libpthread.so.0 to /lib/libc.so.6: 
	normal symbol `getrlimit' [GLIBC_2.2]
	     19595:     symbol=__getpagesize;  lookup in file=date
	     19595:     symbol=__getpagesize;  lookup in file=/lib/libpthread.so.0
	     19595:     symbol=__getpagesize;  lookup in file=/lib/librt.so.1
	     19595:     symbol=__getpagesize;  lookup in file=/lib/libc.so.6
	
	yup, several hundred lines of this stuff, for 'date'. Of course it's kind
	of interesting: Posix threads are used by 'date'. I had no idea that 
	printing a date could be so complex. Maybe that's why it's 40k -- bigger 
	than some OSes. 
	
	The symbol versioning breaks assumptions users have about how shared 
	libaries work -- that they provide a link to one version of a function and 
	if you replace the library all the programs get fixed. I've seen this 
	problem in practice, for both naive users and very non-naive sysadmins. 
	
	The symbol versioning wires programs to something beyond a library 
	version, in a way that is not obvious to most people. To fix a binary that 
	uses a library, you have to replace the binary, not just the library, or 
	you can not be sure anything gets fixed. 
	
	That said, if you can't rebuild all the binaries, well then you're stuck, 
	and have no idea if your new shared library is going to fix anything at 
	all for some of those binaries. Some will stay broken, since replacing the 
	library did not necessarily replace broken functions -- the new library 
	has them too, for backwards compatibility. So the upgrade is not an 
	upgrade.  This is a feature?
