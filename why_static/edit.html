Why has Plan 9 chosen statically linked binaries instead of dynamic
ones? Read below:

! 	gets better. Symbols are now versioned (well, this really happened a few

! 	file (libc-2.3.2.so) has a lot less meaning than it used to. At some
! 	point, given the tight wiring of an executable to the particular library
! 	version, one starts to lose track of just why .so's are still thought to
! 	be a good idea (I mean, on a 1960s-era Burroughs machine with not much
! 	memory, I get it, but ... /bin/cat on my Redhat box at 20K, is not much
! 	smaller than /bin/cat on Plan 9 (22K stripped), and the Plan 9 one doesn't
! 	do symbol fixup every time it runs ...).
! 	
! 	And, as Linus mentioned, TLBs matter. Hmm. Judging by 'ps', cat on linux
! 	needs 256 of them, and cat on Plan 9 needs 6. xclock has got 900 or so, 
! 	and Plan 9 clock appears to have 3*30 or so (3 clock procs when you run 
! 	clock). 
! 	
! 	So you do pay a bit for .so's. You don't gain an
! 	implementation-independent interface for your programs, since the .so is
! 	versioned and the symbols in it are versioned; I wonder what you DO gain?  
! 	The theory always was you could swap out a shared library and swap in a
! 	bug-fixed version, which sounds nice until you try it and it fails
! 	miserably (there was a time when this worked ...)

! 	No, it doesn't help much at all.

! 	Let's take program 'a', which depends on stat. In the new order of gcc,
! 	when built, 'a' will depend on stat from glib 2.0. A new stat comes along
! 	with fixes. It gets built into glibc 2.1. You install glibc 2.1. Program
! 	'a', unless I rebuild or replace it, will be using the old stat. Of
! 	course, I might think that the shared library has fixed all binaries using
! 	stat, and I'm wrong -- or am I right? Is the V1 stat just a wrapper? who
! 	knows? And do you cover all the cases? And maybe it isn't calling stat and
! 	I don't know it. Maybe it's calling one of these:
! 	
! 	000c888c t __GI___fxstat 
! 	000c90cc t __GI___fxstat64 
! 	000c90cc t ___fxstat64
! 	000c888c T __fxstat 
! 	000c90cc T __fxstat64@@GLIBC_2.2 
! 	000c90cc T__fxstat64@GLIBC_2.1 
! 	000c90cc t __old__fxstat64 
! 	000c888c t _fxstat 
! 	
! 	I've found programs that call all these variants, because the functions
! 	they call call different library functions. It's quite interesting to see.  
! 	Which one is 'a' calling? Oh yeah, you can max out the ld.so debug
! 	options, because of course weak symbols come into this game too, and
! 	you're not really sure unless you watch this:
! 	
! 	     19595:     binding file /lib/libpthread.so.0 to /lib/libc.so.6: 
! 	normal symbol `getrlimit' [GLIBC_2.2]
! 	     19595:     symbol=__getpagesize;  lookup in file=date
! 	     19595:     symbol=__getpagesize;  lookup in file=/lib/libpthread.so.0
! 	     19595:     symbol=__getpagesize;  lookup in file=/lib/librt.so.1
! 	     19595:     symbol=__getpagesize;  lookup in file=/lib/libc.so.6
! 	
! 	yup, several hundred lines of this stuff, for 'date'. Of course it's kind
! 	of interesting: Posix threads are used by 'date'. I had no idea that 
! 	printing a date could be so complex. Maybe that's why it's 40k -- bigger 
! 	than some OSes. 
! 	
! 	The symbol versioning breaks assumptions users have about how shared 
! 	libaries work -- that they provide a link to one version of a function and 
! 	if you replace the library all the programs get fixed. I've seen this 
! 	problem in practice, for both naive users and very non-naive sysadmins. 
! 	
! 	The symbol versioning wires programs to something beyond a library 
! 	version, in a way that is not obvious to most people. To fix a binary that 
! 	uses a library, you have to replace the binary, not just the library, or 
! 	you can not be sure anything gets fixed. 
! 	
! 	That said, if you can't rebuild all the binaries, well then you're stuck, 
! 	and have no idea if your new shared library is going to fix anything at 
! 	all for some of those binaries. Some will stay broken, since replacing the 
! 	library did not necessarily replace broken functions -- the new library 
! 	has them too, for backwards compatibility. So the upgrade is not an 
! 	upgrade.  This is a feature?
