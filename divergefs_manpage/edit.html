DIVERGEFS(4)

NAME

divergefs - diverge file system

SYNOPSIS

! divergefs -f rulefile [ -h holefile ] [ -d debuglevel ] mountpoint

! divergefs -p defaultpath [ -f rulefile ] [ -h holefile ] [-d debuglevel ] mountpoint

DESCRIPTION

Divergefs is a user level file server that allows combining arbitrary
number of directories on top of the mount point based on user
specified rules from rulefile. It can be used but not limited to:
modify files on read-only media, speed up compilation where source
code is on remote machine.

OPTIONS

-f Sets the user configuration file which defines what and how the
directories will be combined together.

-h Specifies the file to store file or directory names that were
removed during the mounted session. If holefile exists, it will be
used to initialize the file system, and any file matching the
filenames after mount will be masked out. (default /tmp/holes or
defaultpath/holes if using default path invocation).

-d Allows the user to specify the amount of debugging mes- sages to
be outputted ranging from 1-5. (default 3)

-p Specifies a default path where the holefile will be
defaultpath/holes. If rulefile is not specified, a default rule file
will be written to defaultpath/rules with content of:
defaultpath/files all<> which means that defaultpath/files will be
combined on top of mountpoint. defaultpath and defaultpath/files will
be automatically created if they do not exist. (default /tmp).

EXAMPLES

The easiest way to use divergefs is to invoke it only with a default
path argument and the mountpoint:

divergefs -p /tmp /sys/src

or just:

divergefs /sys/src

in which case the default path will be /tmp. If divergefs is invoked
with default path, it will automatically output a rule file at
/tmp/rules which you can later modify to suit different needs.

Default path is easy to use but is limited to layering one directory
on top of the target mountpoint if you use the supplied default rule
file. For More advanced usage, you will want to write your own config
file. The following is an example:

divergefs.rc

/tmp/bin mode<x> # redirect executables to /tmp/bin

/tmp ext<8> # redirect any files with extension 8 to /tmp

Mount command:

divergefs -f divergefs.rc mnt

After mounting, writing to ./mnt/*/*.8 will be redirected to
/tmp/*/*.8 while writing to executables will be redirected to
/tmp/bin.

It is suggested that you supply your own holefile argument so that
holefile from a different session won't be used, and it won't be
overwritten accidentally. Note: this only applies if you are not
using the default path invocation.

SYNTAX

config_file = (rule '\n')*

rule = path complex_rule

path = absolute_path | relative_path

complex_rule = simple_rule (("||" | "&&") complex_rule)?

simple_rule = concrete_rule '<' setting '>' | '(' complex_rule ')'

Concrete rules and corresponding setting syntax are described in the
next section. Note: relative_path is rela- tive to the current path
at the time of invocation.

RULES

all<> Matches anything. Note: the setting field must be empty.

mode<setting> setting = 'A' | 'L' | 'f' | 'd' | 'r' | 'w' | 'x' | 'e'
Matches file with the given mode. Each mode can only have one
character in the setting field. Please refer to test(1) for details
on the meaning of each charac- ter.

ext<setting> setting = file extension

fregex<setting> setting = regular expression, refer to regexp(2) for
details. matches any file name that satisfies the reg- ular
expression given.

dregex<setting> setting = regular expression, refer to regexp(2) for
details. matches any directory name that satisfies the regular
expression given.

regex<setting> setting = regular expression, refer to regexp(2) for
details. matches any name that satisfies the regular expression given.
