Integration with other OSs


UNIX, AND ITS COUSINS

SSH can be used to gain command line access to Unices, though at
present only ssh V1 is supported by plan9. Version one of the
protocol is often disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled.

Remote file access can be gained using nfs(4) or u9fs(4). U9fs can be
started from a network listner, e.g. inetd(8) or via srvssh over an
ssh link.

To use inetd(1) Add this line to /etc/inetd.conf:

! u9fs     stream  tcp     nowait  root   /usr/etc/u9fs   u9fs

and this to /etc/services:

! u9fs     564/tcp       9fs

Note: the service is defined as u9fs rather than 9pfs as some inetd
implementations treat service names starting with a digit as numeric
port numbers.

MAC OS X

U9fs can be started via ssh using srvssh(4), or by launchd(8), (the
Mac OS X replacement for inetd(1) and /etc/rc[0-9].d/*). Launchd
needs a configuration file of the form:

! <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
! <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
! <plist version="1.0"> 
! <dict> 
! 	<key>Label</key> 
! 	<string>com.bell-labs.plan9.u9fs</string> 
! 	<key>Program</key> 
! 	<string>/usr/bin/u9fs</string> 
! 	<key>ProgramArguments</key> 
! 	<array> 
! 		<string>u9fs</string> 
! 		<string>-l</string> 
! 		<string>/var/log/u9fs.log</string> 
! 		<string>-a</string> 
! 		<string>p9any</string> 
! 		<string>/opt/plan9</string>
! 	</array> 
! 	<key>Sockets</key> 
! 	<dict> 
! 		<key>Listeners</key> 
! 		<dict> 
! 			<key>SockServiceName</key> 
! 			<string>9pfs</string> 
! 		</dict> 
! 	</dict> 
! 	<key>inetdCompatibility</key> 
! 	<dict> 
! 		<key>Wait</key> 
! 		<false/> 
! 	</dict> 
! </dict> 
! </plist>

To cause this to be run on system start, this should be installed as
/Library/LaunchDaemons/9pfs.plist. Installing instead in
/Library/LaunchAgents will cause it to be run only when a user is
logged in, while $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents will cause it to be run
only when that particular user is logged in.

In order to start the listner it must first be ``loaded''

! $ sudo launchctrl load /path/to/9pfs.plist

If you are running the Mac OS X firewall you will need to add an
entry pass the 9pfs protocol in:

! SystemPreferences->Sharing->Firewall

The example 9pfs.plist above uses 9p authentication, described in
detail in u9fs(4), and serves only /opt/plan9.

MICROSOFT WINDOWS

[Cygwin | http://www.cygwin.com] provides a posix environment that
allows u9fs and ssh to be implemented as described in the Unix
section above.

Alternatively a native Windows file protocol client is available as
the contrib(1) package steve/cifs. This has been tested with Windows
95, NT, 2k, and XP.

Problems have been reported with Windows Vista which is believed to
be due to Vista requiring more complex authentication than cifs(1)
can provide. It has been suggested that fixing this is a simply a
matter of changing Vista's default configuration.

The steve/9win package contains a preliminary command line client and
server. It provides slightly tighter integration than ssh, however It
should be replaced by a native cpu server for windows as soon as
possible.

A client for historic NetWare servers is also available in the
package steve/ncpfs.
