DNSMASQ

[DNSMASQ | http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html] is a small
combined DNS and DHCP server designed for NAT'ed networks.

To configure it to send file and auth servers to plan9 machines, use
a command line similar to the following.
! 	dnsmasq -s some.domain \
! 		--dhcp-option-force vendor:plan9,128,fsip \
! 		--dhcp-option-force vendor:plan9,129,authip

Here, fsip and authip are the IP addresses of your file- and
auth-servers. It would make sense to put these in /etc/hosts on the
computer running dnsmasq.

It is necessary to 'force' the options since ip/ipconfig doesn't
actually request these.
