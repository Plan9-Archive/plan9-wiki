#Plan 9 participates in Google's Summer of Code event. We have
#participated in 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and are again applying
#as a mentoring organization in 2014. This has been a really positive
#experience for us and for our students, and we hope to make this the
#best year yet for all involved.
#
#Things are underway for 2014. (See the [program timeline |
#http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014].)
#
#If you're a prospective student, now's a good time to look over our
#[gsoc-2014-ideas] page and think about what you'd like to do for the
#summer. Don't be shy about suggesting your own projects, too; we are
#always happy to discuss project ideas related to the Plan 9 family
#of technologies. You should also probably sign up for [9fans |
#http://mail.9fans.net/listinfo/9fans], or main mailing list, if you
#aren't already on it. You can also check out our [GSoC Student
#Application] template and our [GSoC Student Expectations].
#
#The entire community is encouraged to contribute good summer-sized
#ideas to the [gsoc-2014-ideas] page.
#
#Anyone who wants to follow along in all the GSoC fun is invited to
#join our [Google Group |
#http://groups.google.com/group/plan9-gsoc/]. We do a lot of planning
#and discussion of the program there, and that's where all the
#regular student and mentor reports will go (with consolidated
#summaries sent to 9fans).
#
#If you're a prospective mentor and you're not on our mentor's
#mailing list, contact Anthony Sorace (a@9srv.net).
#
#To make sure everyone's on the same page going in, we've tried to
#make our expectations on various parties explicit. To that end, we
#have pages for [GSoC Student Expectations], [GSoC Mentor
#Expectations], and [GSoC Admin Expectations].
