Plan
9
participates
in
Google's
Summer
of
Code
event.
We
have
participated
in
2007,
2009,
2010,
2011,
2013,
and
are
again
applying
as
a
mentoring
organization
in
2014.
This
has
been
a
really
positive
experience
for
us
and
for
our
students,
and
we
hope
to
make
this
the
best
year
yet
for
all
involved.
<p class='para'>
Things
are
underway
for
2014.
The
organization
application
period
ends
this
Friday
(see
the
<a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014">program
timeline</a>),
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you're
a
prospective
student,
now's
a
good
time
to
look
over
our
<a href="../../gsoc-2014-ideas">gsoc-2014-ideas</a>
page
and
think
about
what
you'd
like
to
do
for
the
summer.
Don't
be
shy
about
suggesting
your
own
projects,
too;
we
are
always
happy
to
discuss
project
ideas
related
to
the
Plan
9
family
of
technologies.
You
should
also
probably
sign
up
for
<a href="http://mail.9fans.net/listinfo/9fans">9fans</a>,
or
main
mailing
list,
if
you
aren't
already
on
it.
You
can
also
check
out
our
<a href="../../GSoC_Student_Application">GSoC
Student
Application</a>
template
and
our
<a href="../../GSoC_Student_Expectations">GSoC
Student
Expectations</a>.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
entire
community
is
encouraged
to
contribute
good
summer-sized
ideas
to
the
<a href="../../gsoc-2014-ideas">gsoc-2014-ideas</a>
page.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Anyone
who
wants
to
follow
along
in
all
the
GSoC
fun
is
invited
to
join
our
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/plan9-gsoc/">Google
Group</a>.
We
do
a
lot
of
planning
and
discussion
of
the
program
there,
and
that's
where
all
the
regular
student
and
mentor
reports
will
go
(with
consolidated
summaries
sent
to
9fans).
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you're
a
prospective
mentor
and
you're
not
on
our
mentor's
mailing
list,
contact
Anthony
Sorace
(a@9srv.net).
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
make
sure
everyone's
on
the
same
page
going
in,
we've
tried
to
make
our
expectations
on
various
parties
explicit.
To
that
end,
we
have
pages
for
<a href="../../GSoC_Student_Expectations">GSoC
Student
Expectations</a>,
<a href="../../GSoC_Mentor_Expectations">GSoC
Mentor
Expectations</a>,
and
<a href="../../GSoC_Admin_Expectations">GSoC
Admin
Expectations</a>.
