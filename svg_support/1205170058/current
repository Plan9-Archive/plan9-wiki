#Another idea that could apply to Inferno, Plan 9 or both would be a
#library for native SVG support. Many (all?) of the primatives in
#draw map to SVG primitives so this should be relatively
#straightforward and open up nice GUI alternatives for both Plan 9
#and Inferno.
#
#Milestones would be based off of particular primitives with stretch
#milestones including support for various types of advanced fills,
#and more complicated manipulation of the SVG objects
#(transformations, rotations, etc.). A simple viewer would be
#necessary to facilitate acceptance of the milestones.
#
#A far stretch would be an SVG editor.
#
#This would be a great project for someone to learn about Plan 9
#graphics.
