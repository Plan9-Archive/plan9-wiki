<a name="REQUIRED_SKILLS" /><h3>REQUIRED SKILLS</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
primary
skill
required
for
working
with
any
of
our
projects
is
the
ability
to
think
a
little
differently
about
problems.
There
are
generally
better
ways
to
solve
problems
in
Plan
9
and
friends
than
simply
trying
to
port
(literally
or
conceptually)
Unix
solutions.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
and
related
projects
put
a
high
premium
on
elegance
and
simplicity
of
both
design
and
implementation.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
vast
majority
of
development
on
Plan
9
is
done
in
C.
Our
libraries
are
custom,
although
they're
easy
to
pick
up
for
anyone
with
Unix/POSIX
C
experience.
The
kernel
and
a
few
libraries
have
a
very
small
amount
of
assembler
in
them.
We
use
our
shell
much
more
extensively
than
most
Unix
systems
(several
commands
common
to
both
Plan
9
and
Unix
are
simple
shell
scripts
here;
see
/rc/bin
for
examples).
There
are
user-contributed
ports
of
perl,
python,
scheme,
and
a
few
others,
but
no
significant
body
of
Plan
9
programs
in
those
languages.
We
have
no
c++
compiler.
</p>

<p class='para'>
With
Inferno,
the
story
is
the
same
in
the
kernel
(almost
all
C,
a
very
small
amount
of
assembler),
but
all
user-mode
code
(other
than
shell
scripts)
is
written
in
Limbo,
a
type-safe
concurrent
language
developed
specifically
for
Inferno.
Limbo
compiles
to
a
bytecode
interpreted
by
the
Dis
virtual
machine.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Other
projects
under
our
umbrella
have
different
constraints;
Plan
9
from
User
Space
is
dealing
almost
entirely
with
C.
Glendix
is
dealing
with
C,
largely
from
the
Linux
kernel.
There
are
projects
with
9p
implementations
in
various
languages.
</p>

<a name="IDEAS" /><h3>IDEAS</h3>
<hr />
<ul>

<li>
Drawterm
on
handhelds
w/
9p
access
to
"interesting"
devices
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
For
folks
using
Plan
9
regularly,
it'd
be
nice
to
be
able
to
have
a
drawterm
you
can
take
with
you
anywhere.
Additionally,
many
of
the
new
breed
of
handhelds
(think
the
iPhone
and
Android)
have
all
sorts
of
interesting
devices
built
in:
accelerometers,
GPSs,
multi-touch
touch
screens,
cameras,
and
so
on.
Pick
a
few
and
design
and
implement
file
system
interfaces
to
them
in
drawterm.

<ul>

<li>
Beagle

or
IGEP
port
and
drivers
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
and
Inferno
are
much
easier
to
port
than
comparable
systems,
and
we
love
to
see
the
systems
running
on
all
sorts
of
devices.
We
have
good
support
for
ARM
systems,
and
much
of
the
community
is
excited
about
all
the
interesting
things
going
on
with
that
architecture.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You'll
need
to
make
sure
that
both
you
and
your
mentor
have
the
hardware
in
question
(or
can
get
it
in
the
timeframe
required,
at
your
own
cost).

</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
At
the
labs
we
get
a
lot
of
interest
in
Plan
9
but
not
having
Java,
which
is
the
de
facto
programming
language
in
many
fields,
is
often
a
deal
breaker.
The
project
would
consist
of
getting
a
jvm
running
and
then
getting
as
many
(non-graphical)
libraries
running
in
the
time
allotted.

<p class='para'>
It
would
be
nice
to
get
support
for
various
IMAP
extensions,
including
starttls,
logindisabled,
digest-md5,
anonymous,
and
sasl-ir
(yes,
these
should
be
all
caps,
but
it
confuses
the
wiki).

better
(application

</li>

<li>
Virtio
device/network/9P
support
for
Plan
9
and/or
Inferno
and
KVM/Qemu
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Virtio
is
a
model
for
devices,
such
as
block
devices
or
NICs,
that
allows
for
greater
performance
for
virtualized
OSes
than
emulation
of
real
hardware.
Virtio
devices
show
up
as
PCI
devices
and
require
a
conventional
device
driver
for
control;
there
is
a
spec
available
at
http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/virtio-spec.
Virtio
on
the
host
is
implemented
by
KVM
and
QEMU
at
least.

<ul>

<li>
Windowing
system
for
handhelds,
Inferno
of
Plan
9
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Handheld
devices
present
a
different
set
of
constraint
from
a
desktop
environment;
typically,
smaller
screens
and
a
more
restricted
pointing
interface
(fewer,
if
any,
buttons).
Come
up
with
a
design
which
fits
with
the
Plan9
and
Inferno
principles
while
working
well
for
users
within
these
tighter
constraints.

</ul>

<p class='para'>
Suggested
by
Ron
Minnich.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Better
wikifs
syntax
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
wikifs
syntax
in
both
Plan
9
and
Inferno
is
very
simplistic,
causing
some
counter-intuitive
results.
It'd
be
nice
to
use
something
like
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>
for
wiki
pages.
In
addition
to
just
the
HTML
generation,
take
a
look
at
how
wikifs
rewrites
pages
in
its
local
store,
which
may
need
changes.
Consider
whether
it
makes
sense
to
allow
drop-in
replacement
formatters.
This
should
be
a
low-
to
medium-complexity
project
for
someone
with
good
C
skills
and
some
experience
with
text
processing
applicaitons.
