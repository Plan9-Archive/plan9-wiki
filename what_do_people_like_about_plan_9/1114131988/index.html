&gt;&gt; A single P9 box is brain dead, it is unable to 
&gt;&gt; demonstrate -any- of its advantages over a traditional OS.
</pre>

<p class='para'>
actually,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
right,
if
you
look
at
the
construction
of
many
of
the
services,
for
instance.
initial
design
is
often
given
a
focus
by
thinking
about
possible
use
of
the
name
space
and
then
the
design
or
structure
of
that
name
space;
when
it
makes
sense,
the
consequent
split
into
name-space
provider
and
name-space
user(s)
can
simplify
application
structure,
regardless
whether
distribution
is
involved
or
not.
thus,
there
is
still
advantage
in
its
use
and
significant
difference
with
more
`traditional'
systems.
</p>

<p class='para'>
now,
a
message-passing
system
(say)
will
obviously
encourage
applications
to
be
based
on
message-passing,
but
plan
9's
name
space
sits
at
a
higher
level
of
abstraction
than
message-passing
(or
soft
SOAP),
and
therefore
comes
in
at
a
higher
level
of
application
design
(i'd
say).
use
of
name
spaces
is
encouraged
and
supported
by
mechanisms
deeply
embedded
into
the
system
itself.
</p>

<p class='para'>
acme
provides
a
good
example
of
using
those
ideas
on
a
single
machine.
it's
a
file
server
but
that's
not
primarily
for
reasons
of
distribution,
and
indeed
i
haven't
seen
much
use
of
its
services
being
subject
to
import
or
export
(though
they
could
be).
its
activity
is
usually
confined
to
a
single
box,
but
it's
still
an
advantageous
structure.
that's
why
i
often
call
it
an
`integrating'
not
an
`integrated'
environment.
the
latter
tend
to
be
self-contained
(i
know,
i
know.
`plug-ins',
where
you
have
to
come
to
grips
with
deep
knowledge
of
the
IDE's
internals).
acme
is
much
more
open-ended,
and
i
shouldn't
think
the
typical
acme
client
has
any
idea
or
need
to
know
what
acme
looks
like
inside.
</p>

<p class='para'>
keyfs
and
factotum
similarly
simplify
the
interface
for
their
clients,
by
being
name
space
servers,
again
in
a
different
way
from
traditional
OSs.
(implementation
of
the
service
itself
is
also
given
focus
by
its
being
a
file
server.)
</p>

<p class='para'>
of
course,
you're
right
that
there
is
still
greater
power
once
the
name
space
is
available
across
a
network.
one
of
the
interesting
things
about
the
Vita
grid
work
to
me
was
how
representing
things
in
the
name
space
led
to
a
simple
yet
flexible
interface
from
the
client's
point
of
view.
it's
described
in
terms
of
reading
and
writing
a
few
files,
and
it's
natural
to
describe
the
protocol
for
the
use
of
those
files.
i
wasn't
involved
in
the
design
or
implementation,
but
i
found
it
easy
to
see
what
a
new
client
had
to
do,
much
more
so
than
with
the
more
traditional
API/ABI
descriptions.

<p class='para'>
when
i
was
first
exposed
to
plan
9,
i
was
a
unix
admin.
the
very
first
thing
that
struck
me
about
it
was
/lib/ndb.
plan
9
was
build
with
networks
in
mind,
and
as
such
the
handling
of
them
is
so
far
superior
to,
well,
everything
else
as
to
be
operating
at
a
different
level
entirely.
no
more
changing
host
names
in
3-5
different
places,
no
more
worrying
about
if
my
dns
data
was
synched
with
my
arp
data
and
so
on.
designing
the
system
around
the
idea
of
being
network-centric
meant
dealing
with
and
organizing
a
network
was
simple,
even
when
not
making
use
of
the
advanced
networking
capabilities
the
system
presents.
the
small
stuff
falls
out
of
doing
doing
the
big
stuff
right.
</p>

<p class='para'>
a
few
days
later
i
had
my
second
big
"whoa"
moment
with
plan
9
while
looking
at
aux/listen.
tcp7
and
tcp9
just
blew
my
mind.
i
could
write
network
listeners!
in
like
three
lines!!!
whereas
something
like
xinetd
is
(arguably;
or
not)
an
incremental
step
up
from
inetd
on
modern
unix
systems,
aux/listen
is
something
else
entirely.
i've
written
cross-protocol
port
forwarding
in
two
lines
of
shell
code.
the
amount
of
times
since
then
that
i've
wished
for
aux/listen
on
whatever
unix
i
was
working
on
at
the
time
is
beyond
number.
it's
not
just
incremental;
it's
totally
different.
and
it
works
stand-alone,
too.
</p>

<p class='para'>
again:
the
small
stuff
falls
out
of
doing
the
big
stuff
right.
</p>

<p class='para'>
and
plan
9
does
the
big
stuff
right.

<p class='para'>
One
of
the
things
I
like
about
Plan
9
is
that
it
requires
almost
no
system
administration,
so
adding
more
`common
applications'
for
system
administrators
would
seem
to
be
just
creating
busy
work.
Barring
problems
with
new
hardware,
after
initial
installation
and
set
up
of
the
main
file
server
(which
is
never
likely
to
resemble
installation
of
any
other
system),
here
are
the
system
administration
activities
needed:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
(re)configure
the
mail
system:
edit
/mail/lib/rewrite;
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
add
a
new
machine:
add
one
entry
to
/lib/ndb/local
or
your
local
equivalent,
plug
the
machine
into
a
switch,
insert
a
boot
floppy
if
it's
a
PC,
turn
it
on;
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
add
a
new
printer:
add
one
line
to
/sys/lib/lp/devices
and
one
entry
to
/lib/ndb/local
or
your
local
equivalent,
plug
it
in,
turn
it
on;
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
add
a
new
user:
type
a
newuser
command
on
your
file
server
console,
have
the
user
login
and
run
/sys/lib/newuser.
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Perhaps
I've
forgotten
something,
but
those
are
the
main
activities
and
they're
all
pretty
easy.
Setting
up
a
console
server
(add
a
Perle
serial-port
multiplexor,
run
some
serial
cables,
and
edit
/lib/ndb/consoledb)
makes
administration
even
easier.
There's
no
sendmail,
so
administrators
can
toss
that
huge
O'Reilly
book.
There's
no
BIND,
so
administrators
can
toss
that
huge
O'Reilly
book.
Without
those
two,
the
main
(l)unix
security
bugs
are
absent.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Familiar
applications
aren't
going
to
get
people
intrigued
about
Plan
9,
they're
going
to
lull
them
into
thinking
that
Plan
9
is
Just
Another
Unix.
</p>

<p class='para'>
I
much
prefer
8c
&amp;
8l
to
gcc
&amp;
gld
and
/n/dump
to
CVS.
Providing
gcc,
gld,
CVS
and
the
like
would
make
developers
think
`what's
so
special
about
this
system?',
rather
than
`gee,
there
are
some
different
and
interesting
ideas
here'.
</p>

<p class='para'>
I
don't
think
that
the
lack
of
interest
by
the
world
at
large
is
due
to
a
lack
of
comfortable,
familiar
applications.
I
think
it's
got
more
to
do
with
a
lack
of
understanding
of
why
Plan
9
is
(*really!*)
interesting
and
a
shortage
of
people
who
find
that
utterly
compelling.
People
have
given
various
excuses
in
the
past
(lack
of
gcc
or
X11,
cost,
licence
terms)
but
if
you're
really
enthused,
none
of
that
matters.
Unix
was
a
hit
because
it
filled
a
niche,
and
what
passes
for
Unix
these
days
is
still
filling
that
niche,
and
for
a
lot
of
peple
that's
good
enough.
Those
of
us
who
can't
imagine
going
back
to
living
on
what
passes
for
Unix
are
a
definite
minority.
</p>

<p class='para'>
So
what
should
be
done?
I
don't
think
we
should
measure
success
by
counting
noses.
I'm
not
even
sure
that
Plan
9
needs
to
be
a
``success''.
We're
using
it,
we
like
it
and
perhaps
that's
enough.
Keeping
up
with
new
hardware
is
a
worthy
goal.
We're
all
stretched
a
bit
thin;
as
far
as
I
know,
none
of
us
are
able
to
work
on
Plan
9
development
full-time.
People
have
various
pieces
of
work
in
progress.
Perhaps
after
the
election,
the
economy
will
pick
up
and
we'll
all
have
more
time
to
devote.
