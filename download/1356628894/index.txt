Inferno is an Open Source network operating system intended for

people that developed Plan 9 using many of the same ideas and
technologies.

PLAN B

Plan B is a derivative of Plan 9 developed by F. J. Ballesteros and
his students. While the original version was based on the third
edition Plan 9 kernels, the Plan B team has moved Plan B into user
space so it can be run on current Plan 9 systems.
