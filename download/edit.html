PLAN 9 FROM BELL LABS

The official Plan 9 sources can be found on the Plan 9 distribution
site at [http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/]. From there one can
download an install floppy or a CD image.

The CD image is built every night from the latest sources and also
works as a `live CD' that can be booted as a working Plan 9 system on
an x86-based computer. The direct link to the CD image is:

 *	[http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/download/plan9.iso.bz2]

ISO checksums: [http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9checksums.txt]

A compressed image of a bootable SD card for the Raspberry Pi is
available from this link:

 *	[http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/contrib/miller/9pi.img.gz]

MIRRORS

The CD image is also available from the following mirrors:

 *	[http://www.tip9ug.jp/mirror/plan9.iso.bz2] - Japan - [Tokyo
	Inferno/Plan 9 Users Group | http://www.tip9ug.jp]

A torrent for a [QEMU | http://www.qemu.org] disk image is available
from the [FreeOsZoo site |
http://www.oszoo.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Plan9_images]. This
image was updated on January 7, 2007.

SHRINK WRAPPED PLAN 9

A shrink wrapped release of plan9 is available [directly |
http://www.vitanuova.com/plan9/index.html] from Vita Nuova. This
package containins a CD of the Plan 9 and Inferno distributions, and
Plan 9 manuals and papers in the form of high quality typeset books.

INFERNO

Inferno is an Open Source network operating system intended for
embedded applications and distributed systems created by the same
people that developed Plan 9 using many of the same ideas and
technologies.

It is now developed and maintained by [Vita Nuova |
http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/].

It can run either 'hosted' inside another os (eg., *BSD, Linux, Plan
9, Windows) or on the bare hardware.

Download page: [http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/net_download4T.html]

PLAN B

Plan B is a derivative of Plan 9 developed by F. J. Ballesteros and
his students. While the original version was based on the third
edition Plan 9 kernels, the Plan B team has moved Plan B into user
space so it can be run on current Plan 9 systems.
