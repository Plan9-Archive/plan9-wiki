divergefs

Divergefs is a user level file server which layers arbitrary number
of directory trees on top of the base directory mountpoint based on
user specified rules from rulefile. Its uses include, but are not
limited to, temporarily modifying a few files on read-only media or
speeding up compilation by storing object files locally instead of on
a distant file server.

This project is developed by Chao-Kuo Lin as part of the [OS
Practicum class at CMU | http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~412/] taught by Dave
Eckhardt [community].
