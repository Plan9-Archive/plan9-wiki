Use latest kernel after a pull

#While updating your system using pull (as per [Staying_up_to_date]),
#your system binaries will be updated. But your kernel does not
#automatically get updated, and as a result you may encounter
#problems. For example, in May 2014, a new system call was added to
#the kernel and some system binaries were recompiled to make use of
#this system call. Executing those binaries without having a recent
#kernel could result in an error.
#
#UPDATING YOUR KERNEL
#
#To solve this problem, you will need to reboot your system using the
#updated kernel that you have pulled. After you have pulled, you can
#switch to the latest kernel by executing the following:
#
#! term% 9fat:
#! term% cp /386/9pcf /n/9fat
#! term% fshalt
#! prompt:  ^t^tr
#
#Optionally, make a backup copy of your old kernel beforehand.
