Use latest kernel after a pull

While updating your system using pull (as per [Staying_up_to_date]),
your system binaries will be updated. But your kernel does not
automatically get updated, and you may encounter problems. For
example, in May 2014, a new system call was added to the kernel and
some system binaries were recompiled to make use of this system call.

To solve this problem, you will need to reboot using the updated
kernel that you have pulled. After you have pulled, you can switch to
the latest kernel by executing the following:

! 9fat:   # The colon is a part of the filename
! cp /n/9fat/9pcf 9pcf_backup  # Optional backup, or edit /n/9fat/plan9.ini
! cp /386/9pcf /n/9fat
! fshalt
! ^t^tr
