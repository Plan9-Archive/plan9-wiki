usb-vga


PROJECT STATEMENT

A variety of low-cost "embedded" machines support Ethernet and USB
but have no video output (e.g., Kuro Box, NSLU2, Soekris). Meanwhile,
there are a variety of USB VGA adaptors in the $80 range (e.g.,
Tritton). The project would entail writing a /dev/draw driver for one
of these devices (your proposal should include evidence that there is
enough publicly available information on your selected device that
you will be able to write the driver).

Note that on Plan 9 a USB device driver is typically a user-space
program (i.e., this project will not require kernel development).
