Getting vncv working on Plan 9 usually alleviates the pain caused by
reliance on specific applications from other operating systems.
Sometimes it is proper to relearn a way of doing things - I wouldn't
use this to get MS Word from a Windows machine when we have a
perfectly good document formatting subsystem using the old reliable
troff, but having a web browser that can keep up with the changing
web-world sure is nice.

What I'm going to describe is the procedure for viewing linux X
applications on the Plan 9 desktop. Other operating systems are
supported but I have no use for them and as a result, no experience.

Firstly, you'll want to download the vncserver from
[http://www.tightvnc.com/download.html] and install it in your system
I copied the files to /usr/local/bin, you do what's best for your
system.

Secondly, on the linux machine you'll want to type (and should see
something like):

! $ vncserver -geometry 1024x768
! 
! New 'X' desktop is linux:1
! 
! Starting applications specified in /home/sah/.vnc/xstartup
! Log file is /home/sah/.vnc/linux:1.log

There are a multitude of settings for the vncserver, but just the
above seems to work fine. The first time you start up the vncserver
you'll be asked to specify a password to access the desktop.

Log out of the linux box above and in the same terminal window, type:
! term% vncv linux:1

provided linux is a system defined in your /lib/ndb/local. Otherwise,
just use the ip address of the machine.

The really nice thing about vnc is that updates are client-triggered
so the server never goes down for lack of input. If you disconnect
from it for days on end and then resume the connection with:
! term% vncv linux:1

(staying with the above example), you get your exported desktop just
as it was when you left it.

Problems can happen on X11 systems, when you want to use the
clipboard between e.g. Firefox and Plan 9, where Firefox uses a
different clipboard buffer than the VNC server. The manual solution
for this is to use xcutsel(1) on the non-Plan 9 system. You can find
an automatic solution at [http://www.nongnu.org/autocutsel/], that
gets the two clipboards into sync, on change.

If you want your connection secured by TLS, you can use
tlsclienttunnel (described in the tlssrv(8) man page) to encrypt and
authenticate your connection. You need a tls tunnel application on
the unix machine, e.g. stunnel ( [http://www.stunnel.org] ). Add a
section to stunnel's config file like this:

! [vnc]
! accept = 7777
! connect = 5901

Change the accept port to your preferences. Create a thumb file for
your vnc server's fingerprint. We will fill it later. Now establish
the connection with

! tlsclienttunnel tcp!yourhost!7777 tcp!localhost!5901 vnc.thumb

You will get a response like this:

! /bin/tlsclienttunnel: server certificate sha1hash not recognized

Snarf and paste the sha1hash to your thumb file:

! echo 'x509 sha1=sha1hash' > vnc.thumb

Now reestablish the tunnel with the tlsclient command above and
connect to it securely with

! vncv localhost:1
