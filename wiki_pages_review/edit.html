The plan is to review all the current pages in the wiki, removing
'junk' pages, and trying to fix and update the valid ones.

Because we can't delete files from the wiki, for now we can just list
them under the TO DELETE list.

Here is the full list of pages in the wiki as of now, generated with
the following command:
! Local cd /mnt/wiki/; ls -Q | awk '{ print " *	[" $1 "]"}'

Take one by one, review if it has any errors or it's obviously
outdated, if you are fairly sure that a page is correct, add it to
the list REVIEWED and include the date and your name after it; if the
updates required are too big to take care of right now, add it to the
FIXME list, with a short comment about what you think needs updating,
your name and date.

If the page is obviously garbage add it to the GARBAGE list with date
and name; and if while it's not obvious garbage, you still think that
the page should probably be deleted(eg., has been obsoleted by
another page), add it to the TO DELETE list with a comment, name and
date.

FIXME

this is more a question than a review. isn't it true that plan9 under
vmware no longer works, and people are encouraged to use xen or qemu?
if so, these two pages should be buried under [old_wiki_pages] rather
than encouraging futile attempts by newcomers. if you don't agree,
please delete this text and move the pages back to the TODO section.
 *	[vmware4]
 *	[vmware_playground_for_plan9]

No, I use a current version of Plan 9 regularly under VMware server.
There are slight problems, but it is workable. Lucio De Re - March
1st, 2008.

TO DELETE

Pages that either can't be opened in acme or the web interface, that
have been replaced, are failed tests, and other junk (should be
self-evident by trying to visit them):

 *	[idiots] - We all already know this... - uriel - 20-03-2005
 *	[index.html] - same as [idiots] but this is confusing as some
	people thinks it's the main wiki page - uriel - 20-03-2005
 *	[rfc9p1] never took off? -mjl - 26-03-2005
 *	[rfc9p2000] never took off? -mjl - 26-03-2005
 *	[rfc9p2000.u] never took off? -mjl - 26-03-2005
 *	[rfc] never took off? -uriel- 21-12-2005
 *	[the plan 9 web server] - doesn't work - soul9 - 03-03-2008
 *	[the plan 9 web server httpd(8) has some interesting features. it]
	- what the heck is this anyways? - soul9 - 03-03-2008
 *	[test2] - weird stuff - soul9 - 03-03-2008
 *	[test page] - some test - soul9 - 03-03-2008

uriel explained the need for the following pages, so my objections
are removed. i leave it to his judgement what to do with them.
 *	[plan_9_documentation]
 *	[intro_to_tools_philosophy_for_*nix_users]
 *	[background]
 *	[summary_of_the_plan_9_development_environment]
 *	[softwaretools]
 *	[plan_9_related_publications]
 *	[twente9con_2004] maybe move to [old_wiki_pages] rather than
	delete, but it doesn't look to be of any interest to the general
	public. [twente9con_2004_report] is much more interesting.

TO RENAME

(random newbie being picky)

 *	[recomended_readings] -> recommended_reading
 *	[video_drivers_development] -> video_driver_development

GARBAGE

 *	[sandbox_two]
 *	[test2]
 *	[new] blank page. at least needs some text describing intended
	use. probably better to trash.
 *	[bleepbybloop]
 *	[test page]
 *	[testtest]
 *	[avoiding_screen_pollution_from_kernel_messges] typo in title,
	proper article is at [avoiding_screen_pollution_from_kernel_messages]
