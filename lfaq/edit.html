INTRODUCTION

 *	What is Plan 9?

Plan 9 is a (relatively) new computer operating system and associated
utilities. It was built by the Computing Science Research Center of
AT&T Bell Laboratories (now Alcatel-Lucent), the same group that
developed Unix, C, and C++.

Plan 9 is a distributed system. In the most general configuration, it
uses three kinds of components: terminals that sit on users' desks,
file servers that store permanent data, and other servers that
provide faster CPUs, user authentication, and network gateways. These
components are connected by various kinds of networks, including
Ethernet, specially-built fiber networks, ordinary modem connections,
and ISDN. In typical use, users interact with applications that run
either on their terminals or on CPU servers, and the applications get
their data from the file servers. The design, however, is highly
configurable; it escapes from specific models of networked
workstations and central machine service.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	For History Buffs

The first edition of Plan 9 was released in 1993, and was only
available to universities.

In 1995 the second edition was available for purchase under a
shrink-wrap license.

On June 7, 2000, the third release was made available for free
download under an open source agreement.

The current, fourth edition of the system was released on April,
2002. At first it was made available under same license as a third
edition, but on 9 June, 2003, was approved new open source license --
Lucent Public License.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What is in the latest Plan 9 release?

The fourth release of Plan 9 provides a major overhaul of the system
at every level. From the underlying file system protocol, [9P |
http://9p.cat-v.org], through the kernel, libraries, and
applications, almost everything has been modified and, in many cases,
redesigned or rewritten. For more details, see the release notes at
[http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/release4.html].

While there have not been any "official" releases for some time
development is very active both inside and outside the Labs and many
changes and updates have been done all over the system; the ISO
images in the web site are rebuilt daily based on the latest source
tree. For updating running systems the replica(1) system is used. See
[staying up to date] for more details.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What are the names of the “parents”?

Plan 9 is the work of many people. The protocol was begun by Ken
Thompson; naming was integrated by Rob Pike and networking by Dave
Presotto. Phil Winterbottom simplified the management of name spaces
and re-engineered the system. They were joined by Tom Killian, Jim
McKie, and Howard Trickey in bringing the system up on various
machines and making device drivers. Thompson made the C compiler;
Pike, window systems; Tom Duff, the shell and raster graphics;
Winterbottom, Alef; Trickey, Duff, and Andrew Hume, APE. Bob
Flandrena ported a myriad of programs to Plan 9. Russ Cox did much of
the work updating the graphics and creating the new disk and
bootstrap model as well as providing a number of new commands; David
Hogan ported Plan 9 to the Dec Alpha; and Sape Mullender wrote the
new thread library. Other contributors include Alan Berenbaum,
Lorinda Cherry, Bill Cheswick, Sean Dorward, David Gay, Paul Glick,
Eric Grosse, John Hobby, Gerard Holzmann, Brian Kernighan, Bart
Locanthi, Doug McIlroy, Judy Paone, Sean Quinlan, Bob Restrick,
Dennis Ritchie, Bjarne Stroustrup, Cliff Young, Bruce Ellis, Charles
Forsyth, Eric Van Hensbergen, and Tad Hunt.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What is its relation to other operating systems?

Plan 9 is itself an operating system; it doesn't run as an
application under another system. It was written from the ground up
and doesn't include other people's code. Although the OS's interface
to applications is strongly influenced by the approach of Unix, it's
not a replacement for Unix, it is a new design.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What are its key ideas?

Plan 9 exploits, as far as possible, three basic technical ideas:
first, all the system objects present themselves as named files that
are manipulated by read/write operations; second, all these files may
exist either locally or remotely, and respond to a standard protocol;
third, the file system name space -- the set of objects visible to a
program -- is dynamically and individually adjustable for each of the
programs running on a particular machine. The first two of these
ideas were foreshadowed in Unix and to a lesser extent in other
systems, while the third is new: it allows a new engineering solution
to the problems of distributed computing and graphics. Plan 9's
approach means that application programs don't need to know where
they are running; where, and on what kind of machine, to run a Plan 9
program is an economic decision that doesn't affect the construction
of the application itself.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What are the advantages to this approach?

Plan 9's approach improves generality and modularity of application
design by encouraging servers that make any kind of information
appear to users and to applications just like collections of ordinary
files. Here are a few examples.

The Plan 9 window system (called rio) is small and clean in part
because its design is centered on providing a virtual keyboard,
mouse, and screen to each of the applications running under it, while
using the real keyboard, mouse, and screen supplied by the operating
system. That is -- besides creating, deleting, and arranging the
windows themselves -- its job is be a server for certain resources
used by its clients. As a side benefit, this approach means that the
window system can run recursively in one of its windows, or even on
another machine.

Plan 9 users do Internet FTP by starting a local program that makes
all the files on any FTP server (anywhere on the Internet) appear to
be local files. Plan 9 PC users with a DOS/Windows partition on their
disk can use the files stored there. ISO 9660 CD-ROMs and tar and
cpio tapes all behave as if they were native file systems. The
complete I/O behavior and performance of any application can be
monitored by running it under a server that sees all its
interactions. The debugger can examine a program on another machine
even if it is running on a different hardware architecture.

Another example is the approach to networks. In Plan 9, each network
presents itself as a set of files for connection creation, I/O, and
control. A common semantic core for the operations is agreed upon,
together with a general server for translating human-readable
addresses to network-specific ones. As a result, applications don't
care which kind of network (TCP/IP, ISDN, modem) they are using. In
fact, applications don't even know whether the network they are using
is physically attached to the machine the application is running on:
the network interface files can be imported from another machine.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What Unix Problems Were Too Deep to Fix?

This is best described by Dave Presotto's 9fans post (from 7 May
2003):

Before Plan 9, we were running lots of Unices held together by a few
networks, a remote file system (different uid's on each Unix), and a
bunch of remote execution commands. We hated it since it was much
harder to manage and use than our old single multiuser machine. We
wanted an environment that not only put together a lot of boxes and
made them look like one but which also would make use of the new
technologies that were appearing (SMP's, heterogeneous architectures,
juke boxes, ...).

The thought was that the new environment wouldn't change from Unix
except where we thought it would make our goal easier to build. The
kernel had to go. The single monitor view of the Unix kernel was a
real pain for making good use of the SMP's. Therefore, we started
that from scratch. That didn't mean that the kernel interface had to
change though. That was a separate topic. Lots of others have
rewritten the kernel from the ground up while maintaining something
that looked more like a Unix.

Ken and Rob thought up the idea of building everything around a
single file system protocol. They also added the idea of a subjective
namespace to try to unify all the binding ideas of Unix. This name
space is the one thing underlying Plan 9. We could have done the same
thing to a Unix kernel (with an infinite amount of sweating) but the
result would have been the same from the user standpoint, i.e., a
system that looks very different. The ease which with it can be done
can be witnessed by the number of failed/stalled attempts to add the
Plan 9 namespace to Linux ...

Also, we were tired of the general kitchen sink nature of Unix,
especially of System V. If there were 3 projects or groups to do a
single thing (like character processing, shared memory, networking,
...) they all eventually got jammed in. We wanted something simpler
to work with.

Lastly, we had all developed an extreme allergy to code filled with
#if, #ifdef, #else, #elseif. Getting rid of that cruft by sticking
differences into separate files/routines required a hell of a lot of
rewriting.

So the result was a different kernel, with a different design
philosophy, a similar but different interface, but mostly the same
old commands.

If you think that Unix was just a single track in comparison, you're
sadly mistaken. We just made more of a bend than others did.

We are guilty of rewriting commands just for the sake of doing it.
The reason there was sometimes legitimate, to match our different
kernel interfaces or whatever. However, it was just as often so we
wouldn't have to worry about Unix licenses.
------------------------------------------------------ 

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

 *	What platforms does it run on?

The Plan 9 kernel and applications are highly portable. Plan 9 runs
on many architectures, among others: x86, MIPS, Alpha, PowerPC, SPARC
and ARM.

Data structures and protocols are designed for distributed computing
on machines of diverse design. Except for necessarily
machine-dependent parts of the kernel, the compilers, and a few
libraries, there is a single source representation for everything.

To find out whether Plan 9 supports your hardware, read [The Various
Ports | http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/port] and
[Supported PC Hardware].

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	Does it support symmetric multiprocessing?

Yes, SMP has been always well supported and over the years it has
been used under many architectures. By default, as it comes out the
box, the release has SMP operation disabled by an option ``*nomp=1''
in the plan9.ini config file.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What about development tools?

[Summary of the Plan 9 Development Environment]

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	Where can I get more Plan 9 software?

See the [software for Plan 9] page.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	Is it object-oriented?

No, not in the conventional sense. It is written in a strict dialect
of ISO/ANSI C. In a wider sense, its general design of making all its
``objects'' look like files to which one talks in a well-defined
protocol shows a related approach.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What about application portability?

Plan 9 comes with [APE |
http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/ape.html], a library that makes it
easy to import POSIX-conforming applications. There is also a library
that emulates the Berkeley socket interface.

See also [Porting alien software to Plan 9].

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What resources does it need?

As might be expected, the answer depends on what you want to do. The
kernel, the window system, and the basic applications will run
comfortably on a PC with 32MB of memory.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What GUIs does it support?

The standard interface doesn't use icons or drag-n-drop; Plan 9
people tend to be text-oriented. But the window system, the editor,
and the general feel are very mousy, very point-and-click: Plan 9
windows are much more than a bunch of glass TTYs. The system supports
the graphics primitives and libraries of basic software for building
GUIs.

Also see the [screenshots] page.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How do I cut and paste with a 2 button mouse?

Plan 9 really works well only with a three-button mouse. In the
meantime, Shift-Right-button will simulate a middle button, but that
is inadequate for acme's chording.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	Does Plan 9 have any Unix-like terminal emulators?

The Plan 9 window system doesn't obey any inline cursor controls,
since none of the native applications use cursor-addressing. All
cursor control in rio, Acme and sam is via the mouse.

To see some excellent articles on this important and divisive user
interface issue read
[http://www.asktog.com/readerMail/1999-12ReaderMail.html].

If you want to get from Plan 9 to Unix systems, you can run vt in one
of your windows, telnet/rlogin to Unix, and set the term/TERM
variable accordingly on the Unix end. See vt(1) for more details;
note that vt can emulate a VT100 VT220 or ANSI terminal.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What character set does it use?

The character set is Unicode, the 16-bit set unified with the ISO
10646 standard for representing languages used throughout the world.
The system and its utilities support Unicode using a byte-stream
representation (called UTF-8) that is compatible with ASCII. On Plan
9, one may grep for Cyrillic strings in a file with a Japanese name
and see the results appear correctly on the terminal.

The encoding known today as UTF-8 was invented by Ken Thompson. It
was born during the evening hours of 1992-09-02 in a New Jersey
diner, where he designed it in the presence of Rob Pike on a placemat
(see Rob Pike's UTF-8 history). It replaced an earlier attempt to
design a FSS/UTF (file system safe UCS transformation format) that
was circulated in an X/Open working document in August 1992 by Gary
Miller (IBM), Greger Leijonhufvud and John Entenmann (SMI) as a
replacement for the division-heavy UTF-1 encoding from the first
edition of ISO 10646-1. Pike and Thompson turned by the end of the
first week of September 1992 Plan 9 from Bell Labs into the first
operating system to use UTF-8 and reported about their experience at
the USENIX Winter 1993 Technical Conference, San Diego, January
25-29, 1993, Proceedings, pp. 43-50. FSS/UTF was briefly also
referred to as UTF-2 and later renamed into UTF-8, and pushed through
the standards process by the X/Open Joint Internationalization Group
XOJIG.

For more details about the history of UTF-8 see:
[http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utf-8_history]

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What about security and user authentication?

Plan 9's authentication design is akin to that of MIT's Kerberos.
Passwords are never sent over networks; instead encrypted tickets are
obtained from an authentication server. It doesn't have the concept
of ``set UID'' programs. The file server doesn't run user programs,
and except at its own console, it doesn't allow access to protected
files except by authenticated owners. The concept of a special
``root'' user is gone.

The fourth edition of Plan 9 includes a substantially reworked
security architecture, described in the USENIX Security 2002
conference paper by Russ Cox, Eric Grosse, Rob Pike, Dave Presotto,
and Sean Quinlan.

[http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/auth.pdf].

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How does it communicate with other systems?

The distribution includes a u9fs(4) server that runs on
Unix-compatible systems and understands the native Plan 9 remote file
protocol, so that file systems of Unix machines may be imported into
Plan 9. It also includes an NFS-compatible server that runs on Plan
9, so that Plan 9 file systems may be accessed from other systems
that support NFS. It includes the full suite of Internet protocols
(telnet, rlogin, ftp).

------------------------------------------------------ 
INSTALLATION AND ADMINISTRATION

 *	What PC hardware works well with Plan 9?

See the [Supported PC Hardware] page.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	Does Plan 9 run under VMware, qemu or Xen?

Plan 9 is ported to Xen and runs well under recent versions of qemu.

VMware used to be supported, but was always problematic and the
latest versions just wont work, VMware wont release the information
necessary to make Plan 9 run properly on VMware, and thanks to Xen
and qemu this days there is no reason to use VMware anymore. Plan 9
does work under Parallels on Mac OS X.

See
[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.plan9/msg/cdd9cbdb362d2c0c]
and [Plan9 with Parallels]

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How do I Install Plan 9?

See the [installation instructions] page.

(FIXME: should integrate into instructions page)

The installation is designed to be run from a PC.

1. Read Supported PC hardware to ensure your PC meets the
requirements. 2. Back up your system. 3. Make sure you've backed up
your system. 4. Read Installing the Plan 9 Distribution. 5. See the
Staying up to Date page for information on how to obtain the latest
fixes. 6. Here are some more questions that have been answered on the
9fans list:

IP configuration ndb/cs will set the sysname if you setup an
appropriate entry in /lib/ndb/local. You must specify an ``ether=''
entry, and the address should be all lower case. If all goes well,
ip/ipconfig will then configure IP. Name Service If you have having
problems, first check that ndb/dns is running. It needs to be started
in /rc/bin/termrc or /rc/bin/cpurc. Also note that only fully
qualified names are supported, and there isn't a separate resolver.
Binding and Mounting Devices Note that ``#'' is the shell comment
character, so you must enclose it in single quotes. For example:
``bind -a '#R6' /dev''. Auth Server When booting a cpuserver without
an auth server, if you give 0.1.0.0 as the auth server address
instead the cpu server's own address, you won't have to wait for it
to timeout.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	Where can I get the stable and current branches of Plan 9?

The stable branch is an Installation CD image at Plan 9 Additional
Software page. It can be used: to install Plan 9, to directly boot
the system from the CD, and to update your Plan 9 installation.

The CD image is built every day from the latest sources.

You can also use replica(1) to update your system either over the
network or from a downloaded ISO.

See [staying up to date].

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How do I setup the VGA?

If the VGA doesn't work, read the document [Installation
troubleshooting].

You'll have to find out more about the card so you can configure it.
The relevant manuals are: vga(3), vgadb(6), vga(8), and 9load(8) and
also see the [supported PC hardware] page.

Put ``debug=1'' (1st line) in plan9.ini and try again. It may not be
of much help but will allow to ask a more specific question.

If you have a Radeon card, you can try Philippe Anel's [Radeon
Drivers].

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What is the Plan 9 equivalent of the Unix find command?

The simplest equivalent is: ``du -a . | grep foo''. A useful
variation is: ``grep foo `{du -a . | awk '{print $2}'''.

See also [UNIX to Plan 9 command translation].

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How do I control the services that start at boot time?

This is controlled by shell scripts, that are roughly equivalent to
the /etc/rc files on Unix:

/rc/bin/termrc for terminals /rc/bin/cpurc for cpu servers

See cpurc(8) for more details.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How do I setup network services?

For UDP services, you must start them up in the appropriate cpurc(8)
file. For TCP or IL services, you must use the listen(8) daemon.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How do I shutdown my system?

If you're using a diskless terminal or cpu server, simply turn it
off. More care must be taken when running a file system, either on a
dedicated file server or underneath a cpu server or terminal. Failure
to do this may result in lost data.

Halt the disk by typing ``fshalt'' at a shell prompt. This will halt
the file system and exit rio(1). On some systems, it will also return
the console to text mode, which can make automated rebooting more
reliable. See fshalt(8) (or read /rc/bin/fshalt) for details.

Then turn off the computer or type Ctl-Alt-Del (or Ctl-Alt-Reset :).

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How do I reboot my system?

The system can be rebooted by typing ^T^Tr (two control-T's followed
by ``r''). CPU servers can be rebooted by typing ^P on the console.
See the cons(3) manual for more details.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How about autologin (or something like that)?

For this purpose you'll need to edit plan9.ini: set up default user
(terminal) ``user=<username>'' and add string like
``nobootprompt=local!#S/sdC0/fs''.

See plan9.ini(8)

------------------------------------------------------ 
GENERAL INFORMATION

 *	Where did the name come from?

It was chosen in the Bell Labs tradition of selecting names that make
marketeers wince. The developers also wished to pay homage to the
famous Ed Wood's film, Plan 9 From Outer Space, which is about aliens
who bring earthly corpses back to life.

 *	Where did the names for Plan 9 components come from?

 *	The name of default user “[glenda | http://glenda.cat-v.org/]” was
	chosen from first full-length Ed Wood film, “Glen or Glenda”.
 *	The original Unix editor was called ed, so Rob Pike called his
	[first screen editor jim | http://man.cat-v.org/unix_8th/9/jim], and
	the next one sam. Sam is actually short for “Samantha”.
 *	8½ is called that as it was Pike's 8 and a halfth windowing system
	-- it also happens to be a film by Fellini.
 *	[Alef | http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/2nd_edition/papers/alef/] is
	named analagously to B and C, just choosing from a new alphabet.
 *	[Acme | http://acme.cat-v.org] is probably named after Wile E.
	Coyote's equipment supplier, . It's called acme because it does
	everything.
 *	The Plan 9 shell is called [rc | http://rc.cat-v.org], because it
	“runs commands”.
 *	Mothra is named after the Japanese horror-movie monster. Tom Duff
	picked the name because Netscape's browser is called Mozilla, a
	portmanteau of Mosaic (its progenitor) and Godzilla, and mothra is
	its Plan 9 ``competition''.
 *	Kfs -- Ken's File System.

The hermeneutics of naming yields few insights. Things are named
usually because the name is nice (sam), or there is some private
reference hard to decode (8½), or in honour (perhaps backhanded) of
another system (mothra), or an indication of expectation (Plan 9,
acme), or just because (acid). None of the names tell you anything
helpful.

Despite the lack of information, those who guess at reasons for
naming generate volumes of apocrypha. The real reason is usually,
``because''.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	What is the symbol/mascot of the system?

The mascot of the system is white bunny [Glenda |
http://glenda.cat-v.org].

[Renee French | http://www.reneefrench.com/] drew Glenda.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	Plan 9 aesthetics are really nice: colors, fonts, and so on just
	``look good''. Who did all that?

Here is Rob Pike's 9fans answer (from 16 Sep 2003):

I can take no credit for the fonts except for having the good luck to
know Chuck Bigelow and Kris Holmes well enough to ask them to do a
deal with Bell Labs and let us use their fonts. The postscript fonts
used in the manual, which are related to the screen fonts (primarily
those used in acme), were the first font designed specifically for
Unicode. I also rather like the screen fonts, which were also maybe
the first.

The clean appearance of the screen comes mostly from laziness, but
the color scheme is (obviously) deliberate. The intent was to build
on an observation by Edward Tufte that the human system likes nature
and nature is full of pale colors, so something you're going to look
at all day might best serve if it were also in relaxing shades. Renee
French helped me with the specifics of the color scheme (she's a
professional illustrator and my color vision is suspect), once I'd
figured out how I wanted it to look. There are still some features of
the color system that I put in that I think no one has ever noticed.
That's a good thing, in my opinion; the colors should fade away, if
you'll pardon the expression.

Having used other systems with different approaches to color screens,
most especially Windows XP (extra pukey), I think Tufte was right.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How can I obtain Plan 9?

The Plan 9 release is available for free download at
http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/download.html. It includes source of
the kernel, libraries, and commands for all supported architectures.
It also includes complete binaries for the x86 architecture.

See the [download] wiki page.

------------------------------------------------------ 
 *	How can I get involved?

The best way to learn about the system is to write something that
other people in the Plan 9 user community could use, or to port the
system to new platforms.

See the [how to contribute] wiki page.
