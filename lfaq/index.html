What
is
Plan
9?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
is
a
(relatively)
new
computer
operating
system
and
associated
utilities.
It
was
built
by
the
Computing
Science
Research
Center
of
AT&amp;T
Bell
Laboratories
(now
Alcatel-Lucent),
the
same
group
that
developed
Unix,
C,
and
C++.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
is
a
distributed
system.
In
the
most
general
configuration,
it
uses
three
kinds
of
components:
terminals
that
sit
on
users'
desks,
file
servers
that
store
permanent
data,
and
other
servers
that
provide
faster
CPUs,
user
authentication,
and
network
gateways.
These
components
are
connected
by
various
kinds
of
networks,
including
Ethernet,
specially-built
fiber
networks,
ordinary
modem
connections,
and
ISDN.
In
typical
use,
users
interact
with
applications
that
run
either
on
their
terminals
or
on
CPU
servers,
and
the
applications
get
their
data
from
the
file
servers.
The
design,
however,
is
highly
configurable;
it
escapes
from
specific
models
of
networked
workstations
and
central
machine
service.

<p class='para'>
The
fourth

provides
a
major

level.
From
the

<a href="http://9p.cat-v.org">9P</a>,
through
the
kernel,
libraries,

many
people.
The
protocol
was
begun
by
Ken
Thompson;
naming
was
integrated
by
Rob
Pike
and
networking
by
Dave

They
were
joined
by
Tom

in
bringing
the
system
up
on
various
machines
and
making
device

Tom
Duff,
the
shell
and
raster

Bob
Flandrena
ported
a
myriad
of

work
updating
the
graphics
and
creating

What
is
its
relation

other
operating

</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
is
itself
an
operating
system;
it
doesn't
run
as
an
application
under
another
system.
It
was
written
from
the
ground
up
and
doesn't
include
other
people's
code.
Although
the
OS's
interface
to
applications
is
strongly
influenced
by
the
approach
of
Unix,
it's
not
a
replacement
for
Unix,
it
is
a
new
design.
</p>
<hr />
<ul>

<li>
What
are
its
key
ideas?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
exploits,
as
far
as
possible,
three
basic
technical
ideas:
first,
all
the
system
objects
present
themselves
as
named
files
that
are
manipulated
by
read/write
operations;
second,
all
these
files
may
exist
either
locally
or
remotely,
and
respond
to
a
standard
protocol;
third,
the
file
system
name
space
--
the
set
of
objects
visible
to
a
program
--
is
dynamically
and
individually
adjustable
for
each
of
the
programs
running
on
a
particular
machine.
The
first
two
of
these
ideas
were
foreshadowed
in
Unix
and
to
a
lesser
extent
in
other
systems,
while
the
third
is
new:
it
allows
a
new
engineering
solution
to
the
problems
of
distributed
computing
and
graphics.
Plan
9's
approach
means
that
application
programs
don't
need
to
know
where
they
are
running;
where,
and
on
what
kind
of
machine,
to
run
a
Plan
9
program
is
an
economic
decision
that
doesn't
affect
the
construction
of
the
application
itself.
</p>
<hr />
<ul>

<li>
What
are
the
advantages
to
this
approach?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9's
approach
improves
generality
and
modularity
of
application
design
by
encouraging
servers
that
make
any
kind
of
information
appear
to
users
and
to
applications
just
like
collections
of
ordinary
files.
Here
are
a
few
examples.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
Plan
9
window
system
(called
rio)
is
small
and
clean
in
part
because
its
design
is
centered
on
providing
a
virtual
keyboard,
mouse,
and
screen
to
each
of
the
applications
running
under
it,
while
using
the
real
keyboard,
mouse,
and
screen
supplied
by
the
operating
system.
That
is
--
besides
creating,
deleting,
and
arranging
the
windows
themselves
--
its
job
is
be
a
server
for
certain
resources
used
by
its
clients.
As
a
side
benefit,
this
approach
means
that
the
window
system
can
run
recursively
in
one
of
its
windows,
or
even
on
another
machine.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
users
do
Internet
FTP
by
starting
a
local
program
that
makes
all
the
files
on
any
FTP
server
(anywhere
on
the
Internet)
appear
to
be
local
files.
Plan
9
PC
users
with
a
DOS/Windows
partition
on
their
disk
can
use
the
files
stored
there.
ISO
9660
CD-ROMs
and
tar
and
cpio
tapes
all
behave
as
if
they
were
native
file
systems.
The
complete
I/O
behavior
and
performance
of
any
application
can
be
monitored
by
running
it
under
a
server
that
sees
all
its
interactions.
The
debugger
can
examine
a
program
on
another
machine
even
if
it
is
running
on
a
different
hardware
architecture.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Another
example
is
the
approach
to
networks.
In
Plan
9,
each
network
presents
itself
as
a
set
of
files
for
connection
creation,
I/O,
and
control.
A
common
semantic
core
for
the
operations
is
agreed
upon,
together
with
a
general
server
for
translating
human-readable
addresses
to
network-specific
ones.
As
a
result,
applications
don't
care
which
kind
of
network
(TCP/IP,
ISDN,
modem)
they
are
using.
In
fact,
applications
don't
even
know
whether
the
network
they
are
using
is
physically
attached
to
the
machine
the
application
is
running
on:
the
network
interface
files
can
be
imported
from
another
machine.

What
Unix
Problems
Were
Too
Deep
to
Fix?
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
This
is
best
described
by
Dave
Presotto's
9fans
post
(from
7
May
2003):
</p>

<p class='para'>
Before
Plan
9,
we
were
running
lots
of
Unices
held
together
by
a
few
networks,
a
remote
file
system
(different
uid's
on
each
Unix),
and
a
bunch
of
remote
execution
commands.
We
hated
it
since
it
was
much
harder
to
manage
and
use
than
our
old
single
multiuser
machine.
We
wanted
an
environment
that
not
only
put
together
a
lot
of
boxes
and
made
them
look
like
one
but
which
also
would
make
use
of
the
new
technologies
that
were
appearing
(SMP's,
heterogeneous
architectures,
juke
boxes,
...).
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
thought
was
that
the
new
environment
wouldn't
change
from
Unix
except
where
we
thought
it
would
make
our
goal
easier
to
build.
The
kernel
had
to
go.
The
single
monitor
view
of
the
Unix
kernel
was
a
real
pain
for
making
good
use
of
the
SMP's.
Therefore,
we
started
that
from
scratch.
That
didn't
mean
that
the
kernel
interface
had
to
change
though.
That
was
a
separate
topic.
Lots
of
others
have
rewritten
the
kernel
from
the
ground
up
while
maintaining
something
that
looked
more
like
a
Unix.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Ken
and
Rob
thought
up
the
idea
of
building
everything
around
a
single
file
system
protocol.
They
also
added
the
idea
of
a
subjective
namespace
to
try
to
unify
all
the
binding
ideas
of
Unix.
This
name
space
is
the
one
thing
underlying
Plan
9.
We
could
have
done
the
same
thing
to
a
Unix
kernel
(with
an
infinite
amount
of
sweating)
but
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
from
the
user
standpoint,
i.e.,
a
system
that
looks
very
different.
The
ease
which
with
it
can
be
done
can
be
witnessed
by
the
number
of
failed/stalled
attempts
to
add
the
Plan
9
namespace
to
Linux
...
</p>

<p class='para'>
Also,
we
were
tired
of
the
general
kitchen
sink
nature
of
Unix,
especially
of
System
V.
If
there
were
3
projects
or
groups
to
do
a
single
thing
(like
character
processing,
shared
memory,
networking,
...)
they
all
eventually
got
jammed
in.
We
wanted
something
simpler
to
work
with.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Lastly,
we
had
all
developed
an
extreme
allergy
to
code
filled
with
#if,
#ifdef,
#else,
#elseif.
Getting
rid
of
that
cruft
by
sticking
differences
into
separate
files/routines
required
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
rewriting.
</p>

<p class='para'>
So
the
result
was
a
different
kernel,
with
a
different
design
philosophy,
a
similar
but
different
interface,
but
mostly
the
same
old
commands.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
think
that
Unix
was
just
a
single
track
in
comparison,
you're
sadly
mistaken.
We
just
made
more
of
a
bend
than
others
did.
</p>

<p class='para'>
We
are
guilty
of
rewriting
commands
just
for
the
sake
of
doing
it.
The
reason
there
was
sometimes
legitimate,
to
match
our
different
kernel
interfaces
or
whatever.
However,
it
was
just
as
often
so
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
Unix
licenses.<hr />

Unicode,
the

set
unified
with
the
ISO
10646
standard
for
representing
languages
used
throughout

The
system

support
Unicode
using
a

UTF-8)

<p class='para'>
The
encoding
known
today
as
UTF-8
was
invented
by
Ken
Thompson.
It
was
born
during
the
evening
hours
of
1992-09-02
in
a
New
Jersey
diner,
where
he
designed
it
in
the
presence
of
Rob
Pike
on
a
placemat
(see
Rob
Pike's
UTF-8
history).
It
replaced
an
earlier
attempt
to
design
a
FSS/UTF
(file
system
safe
UCS
transformation
format)
that
was
circulated
in
an
X/Open
working
document
in
August
1992
by
Gary
Miller
(IBM),
Greger
Leijonhufvud
and
John
Entenmann
(SMI)
as
a
replacement
for
the
division-heavy
UTF-1
encoding
from
the
first
edition
of
ISO
10646-1.
Pike
and
Thompson
turned
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
of
September
1992
Plan
9
from
Bell
Labs
into
the
first
operating
system
to
use
UTF-8
and
reported
about
their
experience
at
the
USENIX
Winter
1993
Technical
Conference,
San
Diego,
January
25-29,
1993,
Proceedings,
pp.
43-50.
FSS/UTF
was
briefly
also
referred
to
as
UTF-2
and
later
renamed
into
UTF-8,
and
pushed
through
the
standards
process
by
the
X/Open
Joint
Internationalization
Group
XOJIG.

<p class='para'>
Plan
9's
authentication
design
is
akin
to
that
of
MIT's
Kerberos.
Passwords
are
never

instead
encrypted
tickets
are
obtained
from
an
authentication
server.
It
doesn't
have
the
concept
of

The

doesn't
run
user

except
at
its
own

it
doesn't
allow
access

<p class='para'>
IP
configuration
ndb/cs
will
set
the
sysname
if
you
setup
an
appropriate
entry
in

Name
Service
If
you
have

problems,
first
check

started
in

Also
note
that
only
fully
qualified

and
there
isn't
a

Binding
and
Mounting
Devices
Note
that
``#''
is

``bind

<p class='para'>
The
hermeneutics
of
naming
yields
few
insights.
Things
are
named
usually
because
the
name
is
nice
(sam),
or
there
is
some
private
reference
hard
to
decode
(8½),
or
in
honour
(perhaps
backhanded)
of
another
system
(mothra),
or
an
indication
of
expectation
(Plan
9,
acme),
or
just
because
(acid).
None
of
the
names
tell
you
anything
helpful.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Despite
the
lack
of
information,
those
who
guess
at
reasons
for
naming
generate
volumes
of
apocrypha.
The
real
reason
is
usually,
``because''.

Plan

aesthetics

Who

</ul>

<p class='para'>
Here
is
Rob
Pike's
9fans
answer
(from
16
Sep
2003):
</p>

<p class='para'>
I
can
take
no
credit
for
the
fonts
except
for
having
the
good
luck
to
know
Chuck
Bigelow
and
Kris
Holmes
well
enough
to
ask
them
to
do
a
deal
with
Bell
Labs
and
let
us
use
their
fonts.
The
postscript
fonts
used
in
the
manual,
which
are
related
to
the
screen
fonts
(primarily
those
used
in
acme),
were
the
first
font
designed
specifically
for
Unicode.
I
also
rather
like
the
screen
fonts,
which
were
also
maybe
the
first.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
clean
appearance
of
the
screen
comes
mostly
from
laziness,
but
the
color
scheme
is
(obviously)
deliberate.
The
intent
was
to
build
on
an
observation
by
Edward
Tufte
that
the
human
system
likes
nature
and
nature
is
full
of
pale
colors,
so
something
you're
going
to
look
at
all
day
might
best
serve
if
it
were
also
in
relaxing
shades.
Renee
French
helped
me
with
the
specifics
of
the
color
scheme
(she's
a
professional
illustrator
and
my
color
vision
is
suspect),
once
I'd
figured
out
how
I
wanted
it
to
look.
There
are
still
some
features
of
the
color
system
that
I
put
in
that
I
think
no
one
has
ever
noticed.
That's
a
good
thing,
in
my
opinion;
the
colors
should
fade
away,
if
you'll
pardon
the
expression.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Having
used
other
systems
with
different
approaches
to
color
screens,
most
especially
Windows
XP
(extra
pukey),
I
think
Tufte
was
right.
