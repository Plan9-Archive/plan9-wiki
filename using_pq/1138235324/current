Using PQ
D1138235324
Arsc (135.104.9.92)
#pq is a client for an `implicit relational' database server. To set
#up the server, one lists attributes (`columns') and where they can
#be found (`this file at this address contains these attributes').
#Indices may be generated for faster access to large files. The
#server is then capable of taking queries from pq and figuring out
#on-the-fly which files to consult to resolve the query.
#
#The major outstanding defect is that real-time updates are not
#possible; the indices must be regenerated by hand periodically.
#
#PQ is available from the Plan 9 [Additional Software |
#http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/addons.html] page and in
#/n/sources/extra.
