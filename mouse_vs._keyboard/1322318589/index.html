<div class='body'> <!-- ***************************** -->

Perhaps
the
most
common
frustration
experienced
by
Unix
users
when
trying
Plan
9
is
that
they
have
to
use
the
mouse
more.
<p class='para'>
The
most
common
complaint
is
that
using
the
mouse
is
slow
compared
with
cursoring
around,
whether
via
arrow
keys
or
via
hjkl
(in
vi,
etc.).
This
simply
isn't
true.
The
mouse
seems
slow
but
is
actually
faster:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html</a>

<a href="http://www.asktog.com/SunWorldColumns/S02KeyboardVMouse3.html">http://www.asktog.com/SunWorldColumns/S02KeyboardVMouse3.html</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
basic
summary
is
cursoring
around
required
a
higher
level
of
mental
planning
to
organize
the
interaction,
which
apparently
obscures
the
perception
of
the
passage
of
time--think
of
being
deeply
engaged
in
something
and
being
surprised
when
you
look
at
a
clock--
whereas
the
use
of
the
mouse
was
done
at
a
lower,
mechanical
level
that
left
the
mind
free
for
higher
things,
such
as
complaining
about
the
mouse.
</p>

<p class='para'>
One
common
complaint
is
that
moving
your
hand
from
keyboard
to
mouse
and
back
takes
time
and
interrupts
typing.
This
is
true,
but
it
doesn't
take
as
much
time
as
you
think.
Especially
if
you're
using
a
keyboard
without
a
numeric
keypad,
the
mouse
can
be
close
by.
With
or
without
a
keypad,
eventually
you
get
to
the
point
where
you
don't
need
to
look
for
the
mouse.
Your
hand
always
leaves
it
in
the
same
general
place
and
automatically
goes
there,
often
in
preparation
for
a
mouse
operation
while
the
other
hand
is
still
typing.
</p>

<p class='para'>
It
is
true
that
it
is
slower
to
use
the
mouse
for,
say,
deleting
a
tab
from
the
beginning
of
every
line
than
it
is
to
use
the
keyboard
and
type
"^xjxjxjxjxjxjxjxjxjxjxjxjxj"
in
vi.
But
at
that
point
you're
basically
programming
the
editor
(with
a
manually
unrolled
for
loop)
more
than
actually
editing.
</p>

<p class='para'>
When
the
mouse
is
properly
accelerated,
many
of
us
find
that
it's
faster
and
easier
to
highlight
the
lines
in
question
and
then
type
and
execute
Edit
s/^&lt;tab&gt;//g
in
acme
or
just
type
s/^&lt;tab&gt;//g
in
sam's
command
window.
This
is
such
a
common
operation
that
acme
provides
two
shell
scripts
so
you
can
leave
|unind
and
|ind
in
the
tag
of
your
window
and
click
on
them
whenever
you
want.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Notice
the
difference
between
acme
or
sam
and
(say)
vi
in
running
editor
commands
like
search
and
replace.
In
acme
you
can
just
highlight
the
section
you
want,
type
the
command,
and
you're
done.
In
vi,
you
have
to
cursor
to
one
end,
mark
it,
cursor
to
the
other
end,
and
finally
type
the
command.
The
cursoring
takes
much
longer
than
the
mouse.
Time
yourself.
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
the
experience
of
many
Plan
9
users,
using
the
mouse
in
Plan
9
for
an
extended
period
of
time
and
then
going
back
to
using
vi
in
Unix
highlights
the
amount
of
time
you
spend
watching
the
screen
as
you
cursor
around
with
hjkl.
Having
broken
out
of
the
hypnosis
that
Tog
describes,
I
just
get
frustrated
beyond
belief.
Yes,
I
am
watching
the
cursor
move
so
I
should
be
occupied,
but
all
I
can
think
is
``damnit,
if
I
could
just
click
where
I
want
to
go
I'd
be
there
by
now.''
</p>

<p class='para'>
Another
point
in
favor
of
the
mouse
is
that
it
is
more
expressive.
Notice
how
the
scroll
bars
work
in
the
Plan
9
text
buffers:
left
or
right
clicking
to
scroll
moves
the
window
proportionally
to
where
you
are
in
the
scroll
bar.
It
would
be
much
harder
to
do
this
in
a
cursor-based
system.
Cutting
and
pasting
in
acme
and
rio
via
mouse
chording
is
much
faster
than
the
equivalent
in
cursor-based
systems,
especially
if
you
are
moving
blocks
that
aren't
line-aligned.
Time
yourself.
</p>

<p class='para'>
It's
important
to
have
a
good
mouse,
of
course.
It
needs
three
real
buttons,
not
two
button
with
an
intelliwheel
in
the
middle.
Plan
9
makes
too
much
use
of
the
middle
button
for
the
wheel
to
suffice.
You'll
just
get
RSI
in
whatever
finger
you
use
to
click
the
wheel.
Logitech
makes
good
three-button
mice.
Most
people
seem
to
prefer
the
triangle-shaped
ones
over
the
oval
ones.
They
used
to
sell
for
$50
apiece.
Now
you
can
usually
find
them
for
$5-$10
on
Ebay.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
most
important
point
is
that
you
need
to
try
using
the
mouse
for
a
week
or
two
before
you
complain
about
it.
You'll
probably
end
up
agreeing
with
us.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You
feel
more
efficient
using
emacs
et
al.
because
you're
always
doing
higher
level
cognition,
while
acme
and
sam
might
feel
slower
since
you're
acting
instinctually
but
you're
actually
moving
faster.
</p>

<p class='para'>
When
one
makes
a
mistake
in
a
search
string,
in
emacs
one
uses
ctl-S
and
ctl-R,
it's
a
pain
to
correct
the
mistake;
the
"Look"
command
in
acme
allows
you
to
just
edit
the
tag
and
rerun
the
search.
