<a name="NETWORKING" /><h3>NETWORKING</h3>

<ul>

<li>
How
does
one
test
whether
the
network
connection
is
up?
ip/ping?
(Yes,
but
first
you
must
run
'ip/ipconfig
ether
/net/ether0
your-ip-address'
or
just
'ip/ipconfig')
-
it
is
often
useful
to
cat
/net/ndb
and
cat
/net/ipselftab
to
verify
networking
parameters
are
set
correctly.
</li>

<li>
Does
'ip/ipconfig
ether
/net/ether0
unbind'
set
the
card
to
a
state
where
it
can
be
reassigned
with
'ip/ipconfig
-g
ga.te.way.addr
ether
/net/ether0
ip.a.d.dr
net.m.a.sk'
or
is
there
more
to
do?
</li>

<li>
Must
the
first
server
on
the
network
(which
will
be
the
dhcp
and
auth
server)
set
its
IP
in
/rc/bin/termrc
(or
cpurc)
or
can
a
well-formed
/lib/ndb/local
assign
it?
Answer:
This
can
absolutely
be
set
in
/lib/ndb/local.
To
do
this
add
an
entry
for
the
machine's
MAC
address
to
the
ndb
file
as
ether=MACADRESS
and
then
invoke
ip/ipconfig
-N.
The
-N
flag
instructs
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ipconfig"><i>ipconfig</i>(8)</a>
to
retrieve
parameters
from
/lib/ndb/local.
</li>

<li>
If
after
assigning
the
IP
in
/rc/bin/termrc
and
not
getting
a
"can't
look
up
my
ip"
error
from
/ndb/dns,
if
one
can't
ip/ping
anything,
what
are
the
possible
problems?
Answer:
to
troubleshoot,
first
verify
that
the
ethernet
device
(#l)
is
bound
to
/net.
Look
at
/net/ndb
and
/net/ipselftab
to
check
if
the
internet
connection
is
configured
correctly.
Ping
is
not
always
the
best
troubleshooting
tool.
You
might
also
try
a
srv
tcp!something.on.local.subnet!port
if
you
have
any
listening
services
on
any
machines
on
your
local
network.
Even
non
plan-9
services
can
still
be
posted
as
a
file
descriptor
in
/srv
to
see
if
the
machine
is
able
to
dial
out.

</ul>

<a name="WIKI_DOCS" /><h3>WIKI DOCS</h3>

<p class='para'>
Some
docs
on
how
to
set
up
the
wiki
would
be
nice.
The
man
page
is
a
little
thin,
and
there
are
a
few
html
pages
missing
in
the
distribution
(create.html
for
one).
When
the

does

editing
a

produces

<a name="IDEAL_INSTALLATION" /><h3>IDEAL INSTALLATION</h3>

<p class='para'>
CPU
servers,
File
servers,
auth
servers,
terminal
servers...
is
there
an
overview
of
what
the
minimum
recommended
Plan
9
system
somewhere?
The
docs
hint
that
a
standalone
cpu
server
would
be
a
good
thing,
as
would
a
file
server,
and
also
an
auth
server.
What
is
the
ideal,
and
what
are
lesser
but
acceptable
alternatives?

</p>

<p class='para'>
You
can
do
most
things
logging
in
as
"glenda"
or
"none"
with
the
default
installation.
However,
part
of
the
idea
behind
Plan
9
is
being
able
to
import
resources
from
other
machines
and
use
them
as
if
they
were
local.
You
can
expand
on
the
default
installation
by
making
it
a
hybrid
CPU,
Authentication,
DHCP,
and
kfs
file
server.
Follow
the
instructions
in
<a href="../Configuring_a_standalone_CPU_server">Configuring
a
standalone
CPU
server</a>.
It's
recommended
you
read
the
following
pages
before
attempting
it:
<ul>

<li>
<a href="../Kfs_file_system_configuration">Kfs
file
system
configuration</a>
-
set
up
new
users
</li>

<li>
<a href="../Compiling_kernels">Compiling
kernels</a>
-
you
need
to
recompile
the
kernel
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p class='para'>
After
converting
your
installation
into
a
hybrid
cpu/auth/kfs
server
it'll
still
seem
pretty
much
the
same
as
before.
The
difference
is
you
can
now
serve
other
Plan
9
terminals
and
systems.
See:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="../Network_configuration">Network
configuration</a>
-
set
up
the
database
to
serve
up
the
right
DHCP
info
to
other
Plan
9
clients
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Remember
to
setup
authentication
properly
and
add
users
to
the
keyfs
database.
I
think
the
syntax
for
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/auth"><i>auth</i>(8)</a>
would
be
</p>

<pre>
auth/changeuser -p username
</pre>

<p class='para'>
this
should
generate
the
necessary
keys
for
'username'.
</p>

<p class='para'>
On
another
machine
you
can
then
begin
to
experiment
compiling
the
kernel
for
a
terminal
which
uses
the
CPU,
disk,
or
both
from
the
server.
Play
around
with
the
'pcdisk'
kernel
config
file
instead
of
the
'pccpudisk'
config
file.
My
instructions
are
a
bit
brief
but
should
give
you
some
idea
of
what
you're
aiming
for.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Other
important
configuration
files
are
/rc/bin/cpurc*
for
CPU
servers,
and
/rc/bin/termrc*
for
setting
up
terminals.
In
the
network
database
(/lib/ndb/local)
of
the
server,
you
should
setup
the
configuration
for
terminals
with
lines
like
</p>

<pre>

</li>

<li>
Does

set
the

<li>
Must
the

on

network
(which
will
be
the
dhcp

server)
set
its
IP
in
/rc/bin/termrc
(or
cpurc)
or
can
a
well-formed
/lib/ndb/local
assign
it?
Answer:
This
can
absolutely
be
set
in
/lib/ndb/local.
To
do
this
add
an
entry
for
the
machine's
MAC
address
to
the
ndb
file
as
ether=MACADRESS
and
then
invoke
ip/ipconfig
-N.
The
-N
flag
instructs
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ipconfig"><i>ipconfig</i>(8)</a>
to
retrieve
parameters
from
/lib/ndb/local.
</li>

<li>
If
after
assigning
the
IP
in
/rc/bin/termrc
and
not
getting
a
"can't
look
up
my
ip"
error
from
/ndb/dns,
if
one
can't
ip/ping
anything,
what
are
the
possible
problems?
Answer:
to
troubleshoot,
first
verify
that
the
ethernet
device
(#l)
is
bound
to
/net.
Look
at
/net/ndb
and
/net/ipselftab
to
check
if
the
internet
connection
is
configured
correctly.
Ping
is
not
always
the
best
troubleshooting
tool.
You
might
also
try
a
srv
tcp!something.on.local.subnet!port
if
you
have
any
listening
services
on
any
machines
on
your
local
network.
Even
non
plan-9
services
can
still
be
posted
as
a
file
descriptor
in
/srv
to
see
if
the
machine
is
able
to
dial
out.

You
can
do
most
things
logging
in
as
"glenda"
or
"none"
with
the
default

However,
part
of
the
idea
behind
Plan

is
being
able
to
import
resources
from
other
machines
and
use
them
as
if
they

You
can
expand
on
the
default
installation
by
making
it
a
hybrid

DHCP,
and
kfs
file
server.
Follow
the
instructions
in
<a href="../Configuring_a_standalone_CPU_server">Configuring

After

I

the

You
can
do
most
things
logging
in
as
"glenda"

"none"
with
the
default

However,
part
of
the
idea
behind
Plan

is
being
able
to
import
resources
from
other

and
use
them
as
if
they

You
can
expand
on
the
default
installation
by
making
it
a

Follow
the
instructions
in
<a href="../Configuring_a_standalone_CPU_server">Configuring

<ul>

<li>
How
does
one
test
whether

ip/ping?
(Yes,
but
first
you
must
run
'ip/ipconfig
ether
/net/ether0

or
just
'ip/ipconfig')
-
it
is
often
useful
to
cat

parameters
are

</li>

<li>

set
its

or
can

Answer:
This
can
absolutely
be

To
do
this
add
an
entry
for
the

MAC
address
to

and
not
getting

look
up

error
from

You
can
do
most
things
logging
in
as
"glenda"
or
"none"
with
the
default
installation.
However,
part
of
the
idea
behind
Plan
9
is
being
able
to
import
resources
from
other
machines
and
use
them
as
if
they
were
local.
You
can
expand
on
the
default
installation
by
making
it
a
hybrid
CPU,
Authentication,
DHCP,
and
kfs
file
server.
Follow
the
instructions
in
<a href="../Configuring_a_standalone_CPU_server">Configuring
a
standalone
CPU
server</a>.
It's
recommended
you
read
the
following
pages
before
attempting
it:
<ul>

<li>
<a href="../Kfs_file_system_configuration">Kfs
file
system
configuration</a>
-
set
up
new
users
</li>

<li>
<a href="../Compiling_kernels">Compiling
kernels</a>
-
you
need
to
recompile
the
kernel
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p class='para'>
After
converting
your
installation
into
a
hybrid
cpu/auth/kfs
server
it'll
still
seem
pretty
much
the
same
as
before.
The
difference
is
you
can
now
serve
other
Plan
9
terminals
and
systems.
See:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="../Network_configuration">Network
configuration</a>
-
set
up
the
database
to
serve
up
the
right
DHCP
info
to
other
Plan
9
clients
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Remember
to
setup
authentication
properly
and
add
users
to
the
keyfs
database.
I
think
the
syntax
for
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/auth"><i>auth</i>(8)</a>
would
be
</p>

<pre>
auth/changeuser -p username
</pre>

<p class='para'>
this
should
generate
the
necessary
keys
for
'username'.
</p>

<p class='para'>
On
another
machine
you
can
then
begin
to
experiment
compiling
the
kernel
for
a
terminal
which
uses
the
CPU,
disk,
or
both
from
the
server.
Play
around
with
the
'pcdisk'
kernel
config
file
instead
of
the
'pccpudisk'
config
file.
My
instructions
are
a
bit
brief
but
should
give
you
some
idea
of
what
you're
aiming
for.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Other
important
configuration
files
are
/rc/bin/cpurc*
for
CPU
servers,
and
/rc/bin/termrc*
for
setting
up
terminals.
In
the
network
database
(/lib/ndb/local)
of
the
server,
you
should
setup
the
configuration
for
terminals
with
lines
like
</p>

<pre>
ip=192.168.0.3 sys=aquitania ether=abc12345def
	cpu=your_cpu_server_ip_or_name
	fs=you_file_server_ip_or_name
	ether=001234fedabc
	bootf=/386/9pxeload
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Sometimes
it's
hard
to
read
web
documentation
without
a
web-browser...
you
can
use
the
VNC
client
if
you
have
a
spare
machine:
</p>

<pre>
vncv machine_running_VNC_server
</pre>

<a name="DEVICE_DRIVER_HOWTO" /><h3>DEVICE DRIVER HOWTO</h3>

<p class='para'>
It
would
be
nice
if
the
Wiki
had
sections
on
how
to
write
device
drivers
for
vga,
ether,
and
so
on,
describing
the
"theory
of
operations."
Also,
waserror()/poperror()/...
stuff
is
really
confusing.
I'd
like
to
see
explanations
on
what
they
are
for,
when
to
use
and
how
to
use
them.
