Plan 9 Wiki Wish List

This page is a wish list for the Plan 9 Wiki documentation. Feel free
to add items you think should be included in the Wiki, or remove
items that have been added.

 *	Make a wish list for documentation additions, changes, and
	removals.

NETWORKING

 *	How does one test whether the network connection is up? ip/ping?
	(Yes, but first you must run 'ip/ipconfig ether /net/ether0
	your-ip-address' or just 'ip/ipconfig') - it is often useful to cat
	/net/ndb and cat /net/ipselftab to verify networking parameters are
	set correctly.
 *	Does 'ip/ipconfig ether /net/ether0 unbind' set the card to a
	state where it can be reassigned with 'ip/ipconfig -g ga.te.way.addr
	ether /net/ether0 ip.a.d.dr net.m.a.sk' or is there more to do?
 *	Must the first server on the network (which will be the dhcp and
	auth server) set its IP in /rc/bin/termrc (or cpurc) or can a
	well-formed /lib/ndb/local assign it? Answer: This can absolutely be
	set in /lib/ndb/local. To do this add an entry for the machine's MAC
	address to the ndb file as ether=MACADRESS and then invoke
	ip/ipconfig -N. The -N flag instructs ipconfig(8) to retrieve
	parameters from /lib/ndb/local.
 *	If after assigning the IP in /rc/bin/termrc and not getting a
	"can't look up my ip" error from /ndb/dns, if one can't ip/ping
	anything, what are the possible problems? Answer: to troubleshoot,
	first verify that the ethernet device (#l) is bound to /net. Look at
	/net/ndb and /net/ipselftab to check if the internet connection is
	configured correctly. Ping is not always the best troubleshooting
	tool. You might also try a srv tcp!something.on.local.subnet!port if
	you have any listening services on any machines on your local
	network. Even non plan-9 services can still be posted as a file
	descriptor in /srv to see if the machine is able to dial out.

WIKI DOCS

Some docs on how to set up the wiki would be nice. The man page is a
little thin, and there are a few html pages missing in the
distribution (create.html for one). When the wiki does work, editing
a page produces

! Object not found
! The object %s open %s failed: %r does not exist on this server.

Note: wikifs must be started before httpd.

IDEAL INSTALLATION

CPU servers, File servers, auth servers, terminal servers... is there
an overview of what the minimum recommended Plan 9 system somewhere?
The docs hint that a standalone cpu server would be a good thing, as
would a file server, and also an auth server. What is the ideal, and
what are lesser but acceptable alternatives?

-- Added page for the above at [Expanding your Grid]. Mycroftiv.

You can do most things logging in as "glenda" or "none" with the
default installation. However, part of the idea behind Plan 9 is
being able to import resources from other machines and use them as if
they were local. You can expand on the default installation by making
it a hybrid CPU, Authentication, DHCP, and kfs file server. Follow
the instructions in [Configuring a standalone CPU server]. It's
recommended you read the following pages before attempting it:
 *	[Kfs file system configuration] - set up new users
 *	[Compiling kernels] - you need to recompile the kernel

After converting your installation into a hybrid cpu/auth/kfs server
it'll still seem pretty much the same as before. The difference is
you can now serve other Plan 9 terminals and systems. See:

 *	[Network configuration] - set up the database to serve up the
	right DHCP info to other Plan 9 clients

Remember to setup authentication properly and add users to the keyfs
database. I think the syntax for auth(8) would be

! auth/changeuser -p username

this should generate the necessary keys for 'username'.

On another machine you can then begin to experiment compiling the
kernel for a terminal which uses the CPU, disk, or both from the
server. Play around with the 'pcdisk' kernel config file instead of
the 'pccpudisk' config file. My instructions are a bit brief but
should give you some idea of what you're aiming for.

Other important configuration files are /rc/bin/cpurc* for CPU
servers, and /rc/bin/termrc* for setting up terminals. In the network
database (/lib/ndb/local) of the server, you should setup the
configuration for terminals with lines like

! ip=192.168.0.3 sys=aquitania ether=abc12345def
! 	cpu=your_cpu_server_ip_or_name
! 	fs=you_file_server_ip_or_name
! 	ether=001234fedabc
! 	bootf=/386/9pxeload

Sometimes it's hard to read web documentation without a
web-browser... you can use the VNC client if you have a spare machine:

! vncv machine_running_VNC_server

DEVICE DRIVER HOWTO

It would be nice if the Wiki had sections on how to write device
drivers for vga, ether, and so on, describing the "theory of
operations." Also, waserror()/poperror()/... stuff is really
confusing. I'd like to see explanations on what they are for, when to
use and how to use them.

 *	The [notes on the Plan 9 kernel (3rd edition) |
	http://plan9.escet.urjc.es/usr/nemo/9.ps.gz] describe the internals
	of the kernel. Most things are still useful to understand the source
	of the 4th edition.

 *	http://www.9atom.org/magic/man2html/9/error Some kernel facilities
	are described in Charles Forsyth's section 9 of the manual.
