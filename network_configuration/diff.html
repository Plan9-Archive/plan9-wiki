<a name="STANDALONE_TERMINAL_NETWORK_SETUP" /><h3>STANDALONE TERMINAL NETWORK SETUP</h3>

<p class='para'>
To
configure
your
network
connection
on
a
standalone
terminal
you
only
need
to
call
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ipconfig"><i>ipconfig</i>(8)</a>
and
run
ndb/dns
-r.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
have
DHCP
just
run:
<pre>
	ip/ipconfig
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
Or
to
explicitly
set
the
configuration:
<pre>
	ip/ipconfig -g &lt;your-gateway&gt; ether /net/ether0 &lt;your-ip-address&gt; &lt;your-subnet-mask&gt;
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
After
calling
ipconfig
make
sure
to
run
ndb/dns
-r
to
enable
dns
resolution.
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
make
this
configuration
permanent
edit
your
/rc/bin/termrc
commenting
out
and
editing(if
needed)
the
corresponding
lines
that
call
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ipconfig"><i>ipconfig</i>(8)</a>.
</p>

<p class='para'>
You
can
use
ip/ping
to
test
that
your
network
connection
is
working
properly.
If
you
have
problems
see
the
"troubleshooting"
section
below.
</p>

<a name="NETWORK_DATABASE" /><h3>NETWORK DATABASE</h3>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9
uses
a
single
database
for
storing
all
the
network-related
configuration
information
in
the
system.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
database
stores
the
configuration
for
machines
specifically
identifiable
by
the
local
installation,
default
configurations
for
machines
in
particular
subnets,
domain
name
resolution
information,
and
mappings
between
TCP
service
names
and
port
numbers
among
other
things.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
database
is
assembled
from
a
number
of
text
files
bearing
a
particular
record
structure.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
default
root
of
the
database
is
the
text
file
/lib/ndb/local.
The
most
important
entry
in
that
file
is
the
``database=''
entry,
which
specifies
a
list
of
other
files
to
include.
For
example,
<pre>
database=
	file=/lib/ndb/local
	file=/lib/ndb/local-cs
	file=/lib/ndb/common
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
It
is
from
the
contents
of
this
file
and
those
in
the
list
that
the
database
is
assembled.
These
files
are
typically
used
by
ndb/cs
commands
in
the
startup
scripts(e.g.
/rc/bin/cpurc).
</p>

<p class='para'>
Conventionally,
the
file
/lib/ndb/common
is
for
standard
port
definitions
and
the
like;
the
other
files
hold
actual
system
configuration.
</p>

<a name="RECORD_STRUCTURE" /><h3>RECORD STRUCTURE</h3>

<p class='para'>
Lexically,
a
record
is
an
unindented
line
followed
by
a
series
of
indented
lines.
Thus
an
unindented
line,
a
blank
line,
or
a
comment
line
(one
beginning
with
#)
ends
a
record.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Semantically,
a
record
is
a
series
of
``key=value''
tuples.
Tuples
on
the
same
line
bind
slightly
more
tightly
than
tuples
on
different
lines,
but
usually
that's
not
important.
</p>

<p class='para'>
An
example
record
is:
<pre>
	ip=10.247.62.235 ip=10.247.60.200 sys=lusitania ether=0060088bc416
		proto=il
		dom=lusitania.domain.dom
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
This
record
defines
a
system
named
``lusitania''
with
a
specified
ethernet
address,
two
IP
addresses,
and
a
fully
qualified
domain
name.
The
``proto=il''
tuple
indicates
that
the
system
speaks
IL,
the
Plan
9
transport
protocol
of
choice.
By
default,
systems
are
assumed
only
to
speak
TCP.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Other
useful
attributes
include:
<pre>
	auth           default Plan 9 authentication server
	cpu            default Plan 9 cpu server
	dns            default DNS server (can be more than one)
	dnsdomain      default DNS domain suffix (can be more than one)
	fs             default Plan 9 file server
	ipgw           IP gateway
	ipmask         IP network mask
	ipsubmask      IP subnetwork mask
	ntp            default NTP server
	nntp           default NNTP server
	smtp           default SMTP server
</pre>

</p>

<a name="IP_HIERARCHY_WALKING" /><h3>IP HIERARCHY WALKING</h3>

<p class='para'>
Most
information
in
the
database
is
not
stored
in
each
system's
record.
Instead,
the
database
query
function
ndbipinfo
(see
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/2/ndb"><i>ndb</i>(2)</a>)
and
its
simple
command-line
interface
ndb/ipquery
(see
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ndb"><i>ndb</i>(8)</a>)
understand
about
the
hierarchy
of
IP
networks.
</p>

<p class='para'>
When
an
attribute,
say
`fs',
is
needed
for
a
system,
the
query
routines
start
by
looking
up
that
system's
network
database
record.
If
it
has
an
fs=
entry,
ndbipinfo
returns
that
value.
Otherwise,
ndbipinfo
notes
the
system's
IP
address
and
walks
down
the
IP
hierarchy
through
the
database,
starting
with
the
default
IP
network
for
the
address.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Specifically,
it
starts
with
the
default
IP
mask
for
the
address,
and'ing
it
with
the
IP
address
to
find
the
default
IP
network.
Suppose
our
address
is
10.247.62.235,
as
above.
The
default
IP
mask
for
the
address
is
255.0.0.0,
so
the
default
IP
network
is
10.0.0.0.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Ndbipinfo
looks
for
an
ip=10.0.0.0
entry
with
an
ipmask=255.0.0.0
entry.
Suppose
we
find
<pre>
	ipnet=ten-net ip=10.0.0.0 ipmask=255.0.0.0
		ipsubmask=255.255.255.0
		smtp=mailserver.domain.dom
		ntp=ntpserver.domain.dom
		fs=myfs
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
The
entry
says
that
the
network
is
composed
of
smaller
subnetworks
with
mask
255.255.255.0,
so
we
look
for
an
entry
for
IP
network
10.247.62.0
with
the
appropriate
mask.
Suppose
we
find
(the
value
in
the
ipnet=
tuple
is
irrelevant)
<pre>
	ipnet=my-net ip=10.247.62.0 ipmask=255.255.255.0
		fs=my-other-fs
		ipgw=10.247.62.1
</pre>

</p>

<p class='para'>
Since
there's
no
ipsubmask
entry,
we
stop
the
walk,
returning
``my-other-fs'',
as
it
is
the
fs=
entry
for
the
smallest
subnet
we
found.
Note
that
the
my-net
record
entry
trumps
the
ten-net
record
entry,
just
as
an
fs=
entry
in
the
lusitania
record
would
trump
both
of
them.
If
we
hadn't
found
the
fs=
entry
in
my-net,
we
would
have
used
the
ten-net
one.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
program
ndb/ipquery
(see
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ndb"><i>ndb</i>(8)</a>)
is
good
for
testing
that
you
have
your
network
set
up
as
you
want,
and
that
the
IP
hierarchy
walks
are
happening
as
expected.
</p>

<p class='para'>
The
default
IP
submasks
are
determined
by
the
first
number
in
the
address:
<pre>
	  0-127     255.0.0.0
	128-191     255.255.0.0
	192-223     255.255.255.0
	224-239     These are reserved for multicast addresses
	240-255     These are reserved for future use

<a name="CONFIGURATION" /><h3>CONFIGURATION</h3>

<p class='para'>
Having
read
the
preceding
sections
you
can
begin
to
define
the
layout
of
your
network.
An
example
configuration
exists
at
/lib/ndb/local.complicated.
A
minimal
configuration
is
presented
here.
</p>

<pre>
database=
	file=/lib/ndb/local
	file=/lib/ndb/common

ipnet=mynetwork ip=192.168.0.0 ipmask=255.255.255.0

	auth=mauretania

ip=192.168.0.2 sys=mauretania
ip=192.168.0.3 sys=aquitania
</pre>

<p class='para'>
In
this
example
we'll
setup
up
the
machine
'mauretania'
as
our
first
Plan
9
machine
and
make
it
the
default
authentication
server
for
our
192.168.0.x
subnet.
We'll
give
our
machine
the
IP
address
192.168.0.2.
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you
don't
intend
to
have
internet
connectivity
you
may
omit
the
ipgw
and
dns
items.
</p>

<a name="IPCONFIG" /><h3>IPCONFIG</h3>

<p class='para'>
Note
that
above
we
have
defined
two
systems,
one
is
'mauretania',
the
other
is
called
'aquitania'.
How
does
Plan
9
determine
our
machine
is
supposed
to
be
'mauretania'?
The
answer
is
ip/ipconfig.
</p>

<p class='para'>
When
a
Plan
9
machine
boots,
it
runs
the
configuration
script
/rc/bin/termrc
or
/rc/bin/cpurc,
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
terminal
or
a
CPU
server.
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
/rc/bin/termrc
you
will
find
the
line
</p>

<pre>
ip/ipconfig &gt;/dev/null &gt;[2=1]
</pre>

<p class='para'>
This
line
causes
the
machine
to
look
for
a
DHCP
server
to
supply
it
with
configuration
information.
You
can
set
up
a
Plan
9
CPU/authentication
server
to
run
a
DHCP
server.
When
you
do
this
the
server
will
look
up
it's
network
database
and
serve
out
the
configuration
defaults.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Nevertheless,
there
isn't
yet
enough
information
there
to
give
a
specific
machine
a
fixed
IP.
One
way
of
doing
this
is
to
bind
a
specific
configuration
to
a
specific
network
card's
MAC
address.
Each
physical
network
card
is
given
an
unique
MAC
address
when
manufactured.
You
can
find
out
your
card's
MAC
address
by
typing
the
line
</p>

<pre>
	cat /net/ether0/addr
</pre>

<p class='para'>
(If
there
isn't
a
/net/ether0
directory
then
Plan
9
did
not
find
an
ethernet
card
on
your
system.)
You
can
now
add
the
MAC
address
as
an
attribute
of
the
configuration
line
in
the
ndb
like
</p>

<pre>
ip=192.168.0.2 sys=mauretania ether=abc12345def
</pre>

<p class='para'>
where
'abc12345def'
is
the
MAC
address.
Of
course
if
there
isn't
a
Plan
9
DHCP
server
on
the
network,
this
method
won't
work.
When
setting
up
your
first
Plan
9
machine,
you
can
modify
the
ip/ipconfig
line
to
specify
a
specific
gateway,
ip,
and
ip-mask
to
use.
</p>

<pre>
ip/ipconfig -g 192.168.0.1 ether /net/ether0 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0
</pre>

<p class='para'>
You
now
have
enough
information
to
follow
the
instructions
for
<a href="../Configuring_a_Standalone_CPU_Server">Configuring

It
will
guide
you
in

ndb/query

ndb/ipquery

up

They

both
good
tools
to

It
