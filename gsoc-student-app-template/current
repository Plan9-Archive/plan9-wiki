## 2011 Plan 9 & Google Summer of Code Student Application Template
#
#Please use this template as a guide for information you send in any
#project application. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all
#information we request is required. Ensuring that your application
#is properly and fully filled saves us all time, so please be
#thorough and accurate!
#
### Personal Information
#
#### Contact Information
#
# *	Name and Email: Your full name and a valid email address. This
#	will serve as our initial primary method of communication, so
#	please make sure it is correct!
#
# *	Chat and Instant Messaging: Real-time chat is free (or at least
#	inexpensive) and is a great way to stay in touch with mentors and
#	others throughout the course of the summer. For example: "dhobsd on
#	AIM; evildho on IRC (freenode, efnet)." We require at least one of
#	these, and strongly encourage participation in our IRC channel,
#	#plan9-gsoc on irc.freenode.net.
#
# *	Phone number: We'll only use this after exhausting all other
#	means of contact (and once before accepting students, to verify
#	it). Please enter a full international phone number.
#
#### Educational Information
#
# *	Institution: What college or university are you attending?
#
# *	Location: Where will you be working from? Some of our mentors
#	prefer to work with students in nearby time zones.
#
#### Biographical information
#
# *	Bio, Resum√©, or C.V: Help us get to know you better. Tell us
#	about your skills, experience, and interest.
#
# *	Code Samples: Summer of Code projects tend to be very
#	code-focused, and we'd like to see some pointers to code you've
#	written, either from your own projects or projects you've
#	contributed to. We're especially interested in things which help us
#	see why you're a good match for the particular project you're
#	applying for.
#
# *	Interest in Plan 9: Plan 9 has lots of great ideas, but they're
#	different from what you find in other environments; we want to make
#	sure you're not coming in expecting Unix. We'd like to know what it
#	is about Plan 9 (or related technologies) that you find intriguing;
#	have you used them before? Which ones (Plan 9, Inferno, v9fs, etc)?
#	Have you read the papers?
#
#### Code Challenge
#
#We want to be sure you understand the basics of Plan 9 concepts and
#coding. Please take a look at one (or more) of the following options
#and submit your solution along with your application. If you need
#any clarification, or have any general questions on any of these
#topics, please feel free to get in touch either via the #plan9 or
##plan9-gsoc channels on Freenode, or via the plan9-gsoc mailing list
#at http://groups.google.com/group/plan9-gsoc.
#
# *	Port SoftFloat/TestFloat
#	(http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat.html); please include
#	manual pages as appropriate.
#
# *	Investigate, identify, and fix issues with 4096-bit SSH keys in
#	native sshserve.
#
# *	I think http://9fans.net/archive/2005/12/221 means that the
#	longjmp() and waserror() documentation should be patched
#
# *	The example code on the tlssrv(8) man page is dangerously wrong:
#	tcp!*!xxx allows anybody on your network to hijack your tunnel. Fix
#	this appropriately.
#
# *	srvssh posts a mode-666 entry into /srv. Fix this to use saner
#	permissions.
#
# *	vncv has some possible issues with ^Z. Identify and address.
#
# *	Wiki bug (via http access): creating a page with a name
#	containing an underscore interacts "poorly" with the "map spaces to
#	underscores" name mangling.
#
# *	Create a simple 9P server to address a small, novel task of your
#	choosing.
#
### Project Information
#
#### Project Overview
#
#Tell us about the specific project you'd like to work on. If you've
#picked something from our ideas page, please make the title match
#what's on that page. Regardless, you should be able to describe the
#project in your own words (even if it's just to show us you
#understand what an existing idea is looking for). Especially if your
#proposal is your own idea, be sure to include enough detail so that
#we understand your idea.
#
#Do *not* copy / paste an idea from the ideas page verbatim.
#
#### Schedule / Timeline
#
#Part of effective engineering is being able to break a project down
#into component parts and evaluate those. Do so: tell us what the
#component parts of your project are and build a schedule for them.
#
#We'd like you to break down your project into weekly milestones.
#This will allow you to get a great feel for the work required for
#your project, and will give everyone involved a schedule to help
#guide project planning along the way. It will also help us evaluate
#the scope and complexity of your project, as well as how well-formed
#your idea is.
#
#### Availability
#
#Summer of Code is a significant commitment. If selected, you'll be
#undertaking a project designed to fill the summer. Please tell us
#about any other commitments you have during the summer. How many
#hours per week are you prepared to dedicate to this? Will you be
#taking courses, as well? Working? Any vacation time planned? This
#should already be included in your proposed schedule above, but call
#out any vacation, late start or other such exceptional issues
#explicitly here.
#
#### Mentor communication
#
#Summer of Code is a mentoring arrangement, and communication with
#your mentor is key. What frequency of communication would you
#expect? Are you prepared to provide progress updates at least a few
#times a week? How are you most comfortable communicating (email,
#blog, IRC, so on)? While our mentors are making a commitment to give
#you time and attention over the summer, "stuff happens"; what would
#you do if your mentor disappeared for a week during the summer?
#
#### Optional: Suggested Mentor
#
#If you've spoken to someone in our community about this project, and
#they've agreed to mentor you for the summer, list them here. This is
#optional, but is particularly valuable if you're proposing a project
#not on our list. If it is on our ideas list, we can mostly figure
#this out.
