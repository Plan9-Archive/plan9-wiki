a
guide
for

Unless
specifically
stated
otherwise,
all

we
request
is
required.
Ensuring
that
your

<ul>

<li>
Name
and
Email:
Your

This

so
please
make

it
is
correct!
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Chat
and
Instant
Messaging:
Real-time
chat
is
free
(or
at
least
inexpensive)
and
is
a
great
way
to
stay
in
touch
with
mentors
and
others
throughout
the
course
of
the
summer.
For
example:
"dhobsd
on
AIM;
evildho
on
IRC
(freenode,
efnet)."
We
require
at
least
one
of
these,
and
strongly
encourage
participation
in
our
IRC
channel,
#plan9-gsoc
on
irc.freenode.net.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Phone
number:
We'll
only
use
this
after
exhausting
all
other
means
of
contact
(and
once
before
accepting
students,
to
verify
it).

Code
Samples:
Summer
of
Code
projects
tend
to
be
very
code-focused,
and
we'd
like
to
see
some
pointers
to
code
you've
written,
either
from
your
own
projects
or
projects
you've
contributed
to.
We're
especially
interested
in
things
which
help
us
see
why
you're
a
good
match
for
the
particular
project
you're
applying
for.

<li>
Interest
in
Plan
9:
Plan
9
has
lots
of
great
ideas,
but
they're
different
from
what
you
find
in
other
environments;
we
want
to
make
sure
you're
not
coming
in
expecting
Unix.
We'd
like
to
know
what
it
is
about
Plan
9
(or
related
technologies)
that
you
find
intriguing;
have
you
used
them
before?
Which
ones
(Plan
9,
Inferno,
v9fs,
etc)?
Have
you
read
the
papers?
</li>

If
you
need
any

on
any
of
these

to
get

I

Project
Information

<p class='para'>
###
Project
Overview
</p>

<p class='para'>
Tell
us
about
the
specific
project
you'd
like
to
work
on.
If
you've
picked
something
from
our
ideas
page,
please
make
the
title
match
what's
on
that
page.
Regardless,
you
should
be
able
to
describe
the
project
in
your
own
words
(even
if
it's
just
to
show
us
you
understand
what
an
existing
idea
is
looking
for).
Especially
if
your
proposal
is
your
own
idea,
be
sure
to
include
enough
detail
so
that
we
understand
your
idea.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Do
*not*
copy
/
paste
an
idea
from
the
ideas
page
verbatim.
</p>

<p class='para'>
###
Schedule
/
Timeline
</p>

<p class='para'>
Part
of
effective
engineering
is
being
able
to
break
a
project
down
into
component
parts
and
evaluate
those.
Do
so:
tell
us
what
the
component
parts
of
your
project
are
and
build
a
schedule
for
them.
</p>

<p class='para'>
We'd
like
you
to
break
down
your
project
into
weekly
milestones.
This
will
allow
you
to
get
a
great
feel
for
the
work
required
for
your
project,
and
will
give
everyone
involved
a
schedule
to
help
guide
project
planning
along
the
way.
It
will
also
help
us
evaluate
the
scope
and
complexity
of
your
project,
as
well
as
how
well-formed
your
idea
is.
</p>

<p class='para'>
###
Availability
</p>

<p class='para'>
Summer
of
Code
is
a
significant
commitment.
If
selected,
you'll
be
undertaking
a
project
designed
to
fill
the
summer.
Please
tell
us
about
any
other
commitments
you
have
during
the
summer.
How
many
hours
per
week
are
you
prepared
to
dedicate
to
this?
Will
you
be
taking
courses,
as
well?
Working?
Any
vacation
time
planned?
This
should
already
be
included
in
your
proposed
schedule
above,
but
call
out
any
vacation,
late
start
or
other
such
exceptional
issues
explicitly
here.
</p>

<p class='para'>
###
Mentor
communication
</p>

<p class='para'>
Summer
of
Code
is
a
mentoring
arrangement,
and
communication
with
your
mentor
is
key.
What
frequency
of
communication
would
you
expect?
Are
you
prepared
to
provide
progress
updates
at
least
a
few
times
a
week?
How
are
you
most
comfortable
communicating
(email,
blog,
IRC,
so
on)?
While
our
mentors
are
making
a
commitment
to
give
you
time
and
attention
over
the
summer,
"stuff
happens";
what
would
you
do
if
your
mentor
disappeared
for
a
week
during
the
summer?
</p>

<p class='para'>
###
Optional:
Suggested
Mentor
</p>

<p class='para'>
If
you've
spoken
to
someone
in
our
community
about
this
project,
and
they've
agreed
to
mentor
you
for
the
summer,
list
them
here.
This
is
optional,
but
is
particularly
valuable
if
you're
proposing
a
project
not
on
our
list.
If
it
is
on
our
ideas
list,
we
can
mostly
figure
this
out.
