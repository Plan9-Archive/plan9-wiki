GSoC 2008 Application Template

! Abstract ::
! 
! [One to three paragraphs (around 100 words should be enough).]
! 
! [Give a 1-line summary, then explain briefly what work the
! project would entail and what the benefits would be (maybe
! one paragraph each).  Mention if this is a new project or
! a continuation or extension of existing work by somebody
! else (this is fine!).]
! 
! Verbose ::
! 
! Name: [your name here]
! Email: [e-mail]
! Project Title: [project title]
! Proposed Mentor: [totally optional]
! 
! Benefits to the community:
! 
! [One to three paragraphs, 150 words should be plenty,
! less is fine if the benefits are very obvious.]
! 
! Deliverables:
! 
! [Break your expected work down into three to six chunks.
! If possible, each chunk should be something which could
! be usefully released to the community independent of
! the others.  For some projects it may be more appropriate
! for each chunk to be a milestone at which point your
! mentor could download your work and test the operation
! of that chunk.]
! 
! [Also specify which chunks you believe would constitute
! minimum completion of the project, successful completion
! of the project, and "time permitting".]
! 
! [Try to estimate (and we understand this will be very
! rough!!) a total number of lines of code you expect to
! write and/or re-write.]
! 
! Background:
! 
! [Describe your familiarity with Plan 9 or Inferno and
! the project (include, if available, a quick summary of
! relevant background from other platforms, including
! applications, modules, or patches accepted by other
! projects, if any).  Have you installed Plan 9/Inferno?
! If so, have you then built a kernel or written a small
! application?  List any major Plan 9/Inferno software
! you are familiar with, e.g., your favorite editor.]
! 
! [If possible, please include one to three links to
! web pages summarizing your work on a patch/project
! and containing source code.  Code can be for a
! class assignment, if you are allowed to make it public,
! or for a personal project.]
! 
! [If relevant, include links to published papers.]
! 
! [Note that you do NOT need to provide all of these to
! as part of a successful application.  But anything you
! can provide in this area will help.]
! 
! Project Schedule:
! 
! [What do you hope to accomplish during the Bonding Period?]
! 
! [If possible, submit a draft schedule:  for each GSoC week,
! from May 26 through August 10, what milestone do you expect
! to reach at the end of that week?  Please mark any weeks
! with conflicts you know about, such as exams, family travel,
! major holidays, etc.]
! 
! [If you are not submitting a week-by-week schedule, you must
! at least indicate what progress you expect to have made by
! the start of the Mid-term evaluation (Monday, July 7).]
! 
! Availability:
! 
! [How many hours per week do you expect to spend on this
! project?  We are not expecting everybody to declare
! 40 hours per week; what we are looking for is a plausible
! agreement between your hours, your background, and the
! project you are proposing.]
