#PQ is an implict-relational database. It is flexible, light-weight,
#and fast.
#
#The main limitation of pq as a system is that there is no defined
#protocol for updates. The system has mostly been used for
#directory-like data, where occasional batch imports happen, and are
#enough. Various update mechanisms have existed in the past, but none
#have been made publicly available.
#
#Another significant limitation (although less systematic) is that
#ev, the current on-disk data store, has no provision for binary
#data. One can work with encoded data, but not arbitrary binary data
#directly.
