Happy users' thanks


A REASON FOR THIS PAGE

Since the beginning of 9fans, the list with its high quality
questions and comments has frequently surprised readers used to other
open software mailing list's standards. For the last few years there
were times when I had gladly written a "thank you" email to the
people at bell-labs, but I somehow did not dare to pollute the list
with such emotional gush. If there are others with similar thoughts,
feel free to add your name and comment. If you think this is stupid,
remove the page.

! you                       etc

! Gergely Födémesi          Thanks! (again).
! Peter A. Cejchan          I could probably never move off the Linux "Without A Little Help Of My Friends"  ;-) Tx!

! Jughead			I'll get high with a little help from my friends! Thanks I love it,
but I still can't code.
