<p class='para'>
Since
the
beginning
of
9fans,
the
list
with
its
high
quality
questions
and
comments
has
frequently
surprised
readers
used
to
other
open
software
mailing
list's
standards.
For
the
last
few
years
there
were
times
when
I
had
gladly
written
a
"thank
you"
email
to
the
people
at
bell-labs,
but
I
somehow
did
not
dare
to
pollute
the
list
with
such
emotional
gush.
If
there
are
others
with
similar
thoughts,
feel
free
to
add
your
name
and
comment.
If
you
think
this
is
stupid,
remove
the
page.
