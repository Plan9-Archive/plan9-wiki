#This page lists known issues with Plan 9 installer:
#
#Open issues:
#
# *	9load wont detect your IDE CD-ROM reader device if it's not set
#	as Primary or Secondary Master. Workaround: set your cd-rom as
#	Secondary Master.
#
# *	Currently there is no way to use a usb mouse during install, but
#	it's possible to install without using the mouse.
#
#Resolved issues as of 11/04/2005:
# *	If using the text mode installer, page will complain about
#	missing $wsys. You can ignore that error message. FIXED by 20h.
#
# *	Kfs broken: one can select kfs, but it doesn't work. Please use
#	fossil instead, kfs is not supported and probably will be removed
#	soon. FIXED: kfs support has been removed.
#
# *	Currently the installer is broken due to missing fcp command used
#	by replica, 20h's patch to add venti installation includes a fix
#	for this. Workaround: you can bind(1) /bin/cp on top of /bin/fcp.
#	FIXED: fcp has been added to the install floppy.
#
# *	If your MBR is not empty(eg., you have installed lilo before) the
#	installer will not ask you install the Plan 9 MBR, you are expected
#	to manage to boot Plan 9 from your existing boot loader or install
#	the mbr by hand. FIXED: You are now asked if you want to install it
#	when choosing "plan9" as bootmethod.
