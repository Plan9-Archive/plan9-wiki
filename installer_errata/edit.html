This page lists known issues with Plan 9 installer:

Open issues:

 *	9load wont detect your IDE CD-ROM reader device if it's not set as
	Primary or Secondary Master. Workaround: set your cd-rom as
	Secondary Master.

 *	Currently there is no way to use a usb mouse during install, but
	it's possible to install without using the mouse.

Resolved issues as of 11/04/2005:
 *	If using the text mode installer, page will complain about missing
	$wsys. You can ignore that error message. FIXED by 20h.

 *	Kfs broken: one can select kfs, but it doesn't work. Please use
	fossil instead, kfs is not supported and probably will be removed
	soon. FIXED: kfs support has been removed.

 *	Currently the installer is broken due to missing fcp command used
	by replica, 20h's patch to add venti installation includes a fix for
	this. Workaround: you can bind(1) /bin/cp on top of /bin/fcp. FIXED:
	fcp has been added to the install floppy.

 *	If your MBR is not empty(eg., you have installed lilo before) the
	installer will not ask you install the Plan 9 MBR, you are expected
	to manage to boot Plan 9 from your existing boot loader or install
	the mbr by hand. FIXED: You are now asked if you want to install it
	when choosing "plan9" as bootmethod.
