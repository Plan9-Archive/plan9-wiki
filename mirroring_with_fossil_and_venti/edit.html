The fs(3) device can be used to mirror your fossil and venti
partitions using several disks. For example, to setup a mirror named
/dev/fs/fossil that is a RAID of /dev/sdC0/fossil and
/dev/sdD0/fossil you need to

! bind -a '#k' /dev
! echo mirror fossil /dev/sdC0/fossil /dev/sdD0/fossil >/dev/fs/ctl

Then you can run fossil using /dev/fs/fossil. It is better to setup
the mirror before formatting the partition and setting up fossil on
it.

If you already have a fossil and want to add another disk to mirror
it, you can setup the mirror as said before, with the original fossil
device (possibly a partition) being mirrored by the new disk, start
your fossil and while you are using it, use dd(1) to copy the fossil
device to the mirror device or partition. Since writes go to all
devices in the mirror but reads are performed just by the first
device (as long as it has no read errors), the copy can be made this
way with relative safety. Races are still possible, since dd might
read a block from the fossil device, fossil might change it and write
it to both devices (original fossil and mirror) and then dd might
write the now-stale block to the mirror, so it's safer to make the
copy when fossil (and venti, if you mirror it) are idle. This might
require booting your file server off another standalone Plan 9 file &
cpu server. So, after the dd on an active fossil, cmp(1) the original
and mirror devices to be sure that a race didn't hit you while
copying. If it did, repeat the procedure or make the copy with all
disks idle.

If you are using a standalone fossil system you need to set up devfs
to read the configuration from a file located somewhere on the disk.
The easiest way to do it (and the least error-prone) is to steal a
single-block partition from the ones already on the disk and to put
the configuration there, as you would do with the nvram partition.
Here's an example:

!  # disk/prep /dev/sdC0/plan9
!    ...
!    swap               20482 1273392     (1252910 sectors, 611.77 MB)
!    ...
!  >>> d swap
!  >>> a fscfg 20482 20483
!  >>> a swap 20483 1273392
!  >>> w
!  >>> q
!  #

(note that you may want to create such a partition on each disc that
is mirrored with devfs, and even mirror the partition itself, to make
sure that if a disk goes away the others will know about the system's
disk configuration)

Now we need to copy the devfs configuration to the new partition.
First zero it to make sure there's nothing dangling in there:

! # dd -if /dev/zero -of /dev/sdC0/fscfg -count 1

Copy the devfs configuration file to a safe place where you can
modify it, and prepend 'fsdev:\n' to the beginning of it:

! # echo 'fsdev:' > $home/devfs.conf
! # cat /dev/fs/ctl >> $home/devfs.conf

Now your devfs.conf file should look something like:

! # cat devfs.conf
! fsdev:
! mirror fossil /dev/sdC0/fossil /dev/sdD0/fossil
! #

Copy that to the partition where the configuration will be stored:

! # cp devfs.conf /dev/sdC0/fscfg

If the configuration file is longer than 512 bytes you will need to
create a bigger partition in which to hold it. Repeat the disk/prep
part with as many blocks as you need. Note that devfs.c imposes a
hard limit of 1024 bytes per configuration.

Now that the configuration file is in place, add a line to plan9.ini,
telling it where it is:

! fsconfig=/dev/sdC0/fscfg

You need to specify a particular disk, because devfs isn't started
yet, and /dev/fs doesn't exist.

Another alternative is to place the config file into your kernel's
/boot. Just add the path to your conf file (eg
/usr/bootes/devfs.conf) to the bootdir section at the end of
/sys/src/9/pc/pccpuf (or whatever kernel configuration you're using)
and recompile (see [Compiling kernels]). Then in plan9.ini, add:

! fsconfig=/boot/devfs.conf

Now configure fossil to search for the disks in /dev/fs/* and you're
ready to boot. Here's a sample fossil proto file:

! # cat flproto
! fsys main config /dev/fs/fossil
! fsys main open
! fsys main
! ...
! #

Write the config file using fossil/conf to the disk where fossil will
search it for:

! # cat flproto | fossil/conf -w /dev/fs/fossil

And you should be set.
