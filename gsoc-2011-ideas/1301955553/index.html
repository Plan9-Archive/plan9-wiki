Plan
9
and
related
technologies
cover
a
huge
range
of
topics.
Below
we've
put
together
a
list
of
some
ideas
which
we
think
would
be
good
candidates
for
stundents
looking
for
summer-sized
projects
with
us.
Each
idea
includes
at
least
a
brief
description
and
a
list
of
"sponsors"
for
the
idea
(people
who've
suggested
it
or
volunteered
to
work
with
folks
on
it).
Ideas
are
rated
for
estimated
difficulty
from
1
to
3
stars
(1=easy)
and
may
contain
links
to
further
information
or
discussion.
<p class='para'>
Note!
Every
year
Plan
9
has
participated
in
GSoC
we've
accepted
student-submitted
projects
not
from
our
list,
and
that's
awesome.
You
are
highly
encourage
to
think
about
how
the
ideas
and
capabilities
of
Plan
9
(or
its
cousins)
could
be
used
to
solve
some
problem
you
care
about
and
submit
a
project
for
that.
We
are
especially
fond
of
things
that
present
their
solution
in
the
form
of
a
9p/styx
file
server.

</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/wikifs"><i>wikifs</i>(4)</a>
in
both
Plan
9
and
Inferno
understand
a
very
small
set
of
cues
when
generating
HTML.
That
set
can
be
limiting.
Replace
it
with
something
better,
like
Markdown.
Markdown
engines
in
C
already
exist,
so
the
Plan
9
part
of
this
shouldn't
be
too
hard.
I'd
suggest
doing
the
Inferno
version
as
well,
to
make
it
a
good
summer
sized
project.
Use
any
remaining
time
to
convert
any
existing
wiki
docs
that
need
it.

Make
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/wikifs"><i>wikifs</i>(4)</a>

✪
(Anthony

</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Our
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/wikifs"><i>wikifs</i>(4)</a>
doesn't
currently
do
any
authentication.
Our
web
server
and
supporting
libraries
have
support
for
http
authentication,
but
using
data
stored
in
the
file
system
directly.
It
would
be
nice
if
web
applications
could
authenticate
against
a
real
Plan
9
authentication
server.
A
student
submitting
a
proposal
for
this
should
also
investigate
what's
involved
in
getting
wikifs
working
over
https
(it
shouldn't
be
much)
to
ensure
passwords
are
submitted
securely.

Port

NDISulator
✪✪
(Dave
Eckhardt)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
NDISulator
is
a
FreeBSD
utility
which
facilitates
using
device
drivers
for
Windows
network
cards
in
FreeBSD.
Plan
9
faces
the
same
problems
that
led
the
FreeBSD
folks
to
this,
most
especially
vendors
who
don't
release
decent
information
on
their
parts.
Port
the
NDISulator
so
that
we
can
use
drivers
written
for
Windows
within
Plan
9.

</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Plan
9's
C
compiler
has
generated
other
types
of
object
files
in
the
past;
it
would
be
useful
if
it
could
generate
things
Windows
understands.
This
is
a
major
undertaking
as
windows
has
a
variety
of
calling

and
very
different

However
mingw
has
tools
to
generate

which
are
very
similar
to

initially

It's
noteworthy
that

<p class='para'>
Write

for
encoding

This
is
a
useful
step
towards
future
LDAP
work.
This
shouldn't
be
too
hard
(and
there's
lots
of

but
it
will
involve
reading
lots
of
RFCs

testing.

(Erik

</ul>

<p class='para'>
In
Plan

you
don't
need
NAT:
just
import
the
gateway's
network.
Sadly,
we
don't
live
in
a
Plan
9-only
world.
Write
what's
needed
to
allow
Plan
9
to
act
as
a

This
should
be
at

mostly
(and
perhaps
entirely)
doable

can
handle

It's
not
clear
that
x2apic

worth
it,
but
most
of
the
fun
would
be
in
working
out
that
problem
on
24-core

driving
10gbe.
It's
also
not

<ul>

<li>
msi

✪✪✪
(Erik

<p class='para'>
Similar.
Evaluating
msi
requires
doing
some
careful
timing
and
working
out
how
msi
relates
to
the
rest
of
the
system.
Can
you
ditch
apic
if
you
go
straight
for
msi

Is
the
performance
and
configuration
pain
worth
it?
This
is
more

better
payoff.

<ul>

<li>
Make
a
keyboard
file
server
✪
(Erik
Quanstrom)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
There
are
several
cases
where
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
stand-alone
software
console.
The
in-kernel
console
(rightly)
doesn't
handle
interrupts
and
does
only
the
most
basic
keyboard
processing.
Other
software,
like
telnet,
implements
its
own
console
handling,
as
does
rio.
It
would
be
nice
to
refactor
this
into
a
stand-alone
file
server
that
handles
these
functions
and
could
be
used
by
all
these
functions,
or
directly
on
the
cga
console.

<li>
Create
an
alternative
window
manager
✪
(John
Floren)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
For
some,
rio
represents
a
barrier
to
entry--complaints
that
it
is
hard
to
use
or
ugly
have
frequently
appeared.
It
would
be
nice
to
have
an
alternative
window
manager
for
those
people
who
don't
like
rio,
perhaps
something
with
more
traditional
title
bars,
minimize/maximize/close
buttons,
etc.
Rio
could
serve
as
a
base
for
this
effort
if
desired,
since
it
already
handles
the
necessary
multiplexing
and
drawing
operations.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Make
a
widget
library
✪✪
(John
Floren)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Libpanel
is
old
and
unmaintained,
libcontrol
doesn't
include
e.g.
a
multi-line
text
entry
area,
and
both
look
rather
outdated.
It
would
be
nice
to
have
a
widget
library
including
buttons,
drop-down
menus,
multiple-line
text
entry,
radio
buttons,
scrollbars,
etc.
The
tk
library
in
Inferno
does
pretty
much
everything
desired.

<ul>

<li>
Kernel.org
for
Plan
9
✪✪✪
(Ron
Minnich)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
Linux
kernel.org
provides
a
very
rich
environment
for
prototyping
linux
enhancements.
It
also
uses
a
well-known
SCM
(git)
which
removes
one
barrier
to
entry
for
new
users.
This
project
would
set
up
a
kernel.org-like
entity
that
uses
mercurial,
supports
forks,
and
has
a
well-defined
path
for
inclusion
into
the
base
"kernel.org"
repo.
It
would
also
support
a
process
for
regular
updates
from
sources.
Finally,
all
contrib
packages
would
be
included,
but
not
integrated
into
/sys/src
(to
make
pulls
from
sources
viable);
rather,
they
would
live
in
a
seperate
tree
called
/contrib
(both
source
and
binary).
Learning
the
lessons
from
kernel.org
is
strongly
encouraged,
but
implementing
this
system
in
a
Plan
9-friendly
manner
is
essential.

<ul>

<li>
Finishing
up
ratrace
✪✪
(Ron
Minnich)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Ratrace
(Plan
9
version
of
strace)
needs
a
few
fixes:
allowing
users
to
get
both
binary
and
pretty
output
from
programs;
allowing
users
to
set
the
amount
of
data
dumped
for
read
and
write;
fixing
a
remaining
few
races
when
children
fork;
and
allowing
ratrace
to
trace
itself.
This
is
a
pretty
straightforward
project
that
would
allow
students
to
make
minimal
changes
to
the
kernel
and
still
learn
a
lot.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
KVM/Virtio
Drivers
✪✪
(Eric
Van
Hensbergen)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
One
of
the
environments
many
people
run
Plan
9
under
is
Qemu/KVM
--
but
the
virtio
drivers
(which
are
required
for
high-performance
disk
or
network
access)
aren't
currently
supported
in
mainline
Plan
9.
The
student(s)
would
get
virtio
drivers
for
first
the
network
and
then
the
block
device
(or
perhaps
one
student
for
each)
working
and
in
a
form
suitable
for
acceptance
in
the
mainline
Plan
9
kernel
against
either
the
tip
Qemu
or
a
recent
Qemu/KVM
distribution
(say
Ubuntu
10.10).
I
believe
this
task
is
relatively
straightforward
and
requires
no
special
hardware
outside
of
a
PC
capable
of
running
Qemu.
If
there
was
sufficient
time
the
student
could
work
on
other
virtio
drivers
(native
9P,
console,
etc)
The
student
will
also
be
responsible
for
doing
a
base-level
performance
evaluation
of
virtio
drivers
versus
emulated
drivers
for
some
standard
operations
(disk
access,
fossil
access,
venti
access,
network
stream,
etc.)
The
cool
thing
is,
it'd
be
honest
kernel
work,
and
have
tangible
results
we
could
all
use
within
a
month
or
so
of
effort.
