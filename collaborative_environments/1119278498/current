#Plan 9 provides a great infrastructure for sharing resources
#including interfaces to interactive applications (such as windows in
#rio and ACME). Developing a more complete interface to these sharing
#facilities would promote their use in daily activites. Combining
#these extensions with [Cross domain authentication] may allow
#greater collaboration between the now widely distributed developer
#community.
#
#There are a number of topics and ideas in this area amounting to how
#to share, when to share, levels of trust, levels of respect, etc.
#I'll do my best to fill out this page with my ideas as time permits.
