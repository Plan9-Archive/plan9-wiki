The VmWare links below are a little old but should still work,
however we now use VESA to access the VmWare framestore, and this
does not support hardware acceleration. Thus you will need to disable
this as soon as you have booted plan9, ideally put the command below
in /rc/bin/termrc so it will be done for you.

! echo hwaccel off > /dev/vgactl

In VMWare Server (and possibly other versions), although the
installation can be done using either IDE or SCSI cdrom drives for
the hosted OS, it is necessary to switch the virtual machine's cdrom
type to SCSI prior to actually booting Plan 9 from the hard drive.

AUDIO for VmWARE Server

VmWare Server was made to bring up sb16 emulation; however not
without some extraneous artifacts in the audio. There seem to be
timing problems. Perhaps someone knows a better setting to implement.
Here is my setup:

Find your vmx file where the Vmware Guest files are stored: (e.g.
/var/lib/vmware/Virtual Machines/plan9/plan9.vmx)

Make sure the configuration does not have a sound card installed by
the Vmware wizard.

Then edit your vmx configuration file with your favorite text editor,
and add the following lines:

! sound.present = "TRUE"
! sound.virtualDev = "sb16"
! sound.baseAddr = "0x220"
! sound.dma16 = "5"
! sound.dma8 = "1"
! sound.irq = "5"
! sound.mpu401baseAddr = "0x330"
! sound.Opl3BaseAddr = "0x388"
! sound.smallBlockSize = 1024
! sound.maxLength = 2048
! sound.buffering = "10000000000.0"
! sound.copyDelayFactor = "1000000.0"
! sound.directSound = "false" 
! sound.highPriority = "true"
! sound.ignoreOverflows = "true"
! sound.virtualrealcorrection ="10000000000.0"
! pciSound.priorityBoost = "true"

Then boot your Plan 9 guest and add the following to plan9.ini:

! audio0=type=sb16 port=0x220 irq=5 dma=5

Before trying the audio feature, you must reboot your Plan 9 guest
and once logged in, do:

! term% bind -a '#A' /dev

Make sure the rio window covers a significant area of the screen, or
otherwise the audio driver seems to give garbage beeps and groans
instead of the audio you want.

! term % cat a000 > /dev/audio

The audio that comes out is interrupted by short and frequent timing
jitters. When you resize the rio window while the audio is playing,
the artifacts go away for awhile, but there is a more pronounced
interruption during the resizing operation.
