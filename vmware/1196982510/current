#The VmWare links below are a little old but should still work,
#however we now use VESA to access the VmWare framestore, and this
#does not support hardware acceleration. Thus you will need to
#disable this as soon as you have booted plan9, ideally put the
#command below in /rc/bin/termrc so it will be done for you.
#
#! echo hwaccel off > /dev/vgactl
#
#In VMWare Server (and possibly other versions), although the
#installation can be done using either IDE or SCSI cdrom drives for
#the hosted OS, it is necessary to switch the virtual machine's cdrom
#type to SCSI prior to actually booting Plan 9 from the hard drive.

#AUDIO for VmWARE Server
#
#VmWare Server was made to bring up sb16 emulation; however not
#without some extraneous artifacts in the audio. There seem to be
#timing problems. Perhaps someone knows a better setting to
#implement. Here is my setup:
#
#Find your vmx file where the Vmware Guest files are stored: (e.g.
#/var/lib/vmware/Virtual Machines/plan9/plan9.vmx)
#
#Make sure the configuration does not have a sound card installed by
#the Vmware wizard.
#
#Then edit your vmx configuration file with your favorite text
#editor, and add the following lines:
#
#! sound.present = "TRUE"
#! sound.virtualDev = "sb16"
#! sound.baseAddr = "0x220"
#! sound.dma16 = "5"
#! sound.dma8 = "1"
#! sound.irq = "5"
#! sound.mpu401baseAddr = "0x330"
#! sound.Opl3BaseAddr = "0x388"
#! sound.smallBlockSize = 1024
#! sound.maxLength = 2048
#! sound.buffering = "10000000000.0"
#! sound.copyDelayFactor = "1000000.0"
#! sound.directSound = "false" 
#! sound.highPriority = "true"
#! sound.ignoreOverflows = "true"
#! sound.virtualrealcorrection ="10000000000.0"
#! pciSound.priorityBoost = "true"
#
#Then boot your Plan 9 guest and add the following to plan9.ini:
#
#! audio0=type=sb16 port=0x220 irq=5 dma=5
#
#Before trying the audio feature, you must reboot your Plan 9 guest
#and once logged in, do:
#
#! term% bind -a '#A' /dev
#
#Make sure the rio window covers a significant area of the screen, or
#otherwise the audio driver seems to give garbage beeps and groans
#instead of the audio you want.
#
#! term % cat a000 > /dev/audio
#
#The audio that comes out is interrupted by short and frequent timing
#jitters. When you resize the rio window while the audio is playing,
#the artifacts go away for awhile, but there is a more pronounced
#interruption during the resizing operation.
