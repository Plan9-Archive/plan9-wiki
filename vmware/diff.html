</div><hr />The
VmWare
links
below
are
a
little
old
but
should
still
work,
however
we
now
use
VESA
to
access
the
VmWare
framestore,
and
this
does
not
support
hardware
acceleration.
Thus
you
will
need
to
disable
this
as
soon
as
you
have
booted
plan9,
ideally
put
the
command
below
in
/rc/bin/termrc
so
it
will
be
done
for
you.
<pre>
echo hwaccel off &gt; /dev/vgactl
</pre>

<p class='para'>
In
VMWare
Server
(and
possibly
other
versions),
although
the
installation
can
be
done
using
either
IDE
or
SCSI
cdrom
drives
for
the
hosted
OS,
it
is
necessary
to
switch
the
virtual
machine's
cdrom
type
to
SCSI
prior
to
actually
booting
Plan
9
from
the
hard
drive.

AUDIO
for
VmWARE
Server
</p>

<p class='para'>
VmWare
Server
was
made
to
bring
up
sb16
emulation;
however
not
without
some
extraneous
artifacts
in
the
audio.
There
seem
to
be
timing
problems.
Perhaps
someone
knows
a
better
setting
to
implement.
Here
is
my
setup:
</p>

<p class='para'>
Find
your
vmx
file
where
the
Vmware
Guest
files
are
stored:
(e.g.
/var/lib/vmware/Virtual
Machines/plan9/plan9.vmx)
</p>

<p class='para'>
Make
sure
the
configuration
does
not
have
a
sound
card
installed
by
the
Vmware
wizard.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Then
edit
your
vmx
configuration
file
with
your
favorite
text
editor,
and
add
the
following
lines:
</p>

<pre>
sound.present = "TRUE"
sound.virtualDev = "sb16"
sound.baseAddr = "0x220"
sound.dma16 = "5"
sound.dma8 = "1"
sound.irq = "5"
sound.mpu401baseAddr = "0x330"
sound.Opl3BaseAddr = "0x388"
sound.smallBlockSize = 1024
sound.maxLength = 2048
sound.buffering = "10000000000.0"
sound.copyDelayFactor = "1000000.0"
sound.directSound = "false" 
sound.highPriority = "true"
sound.ignoreOverflows = "true"
sound.virtualrealcorrection ="10000000000.0"
pciSound.priorityBoost = "true"
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Then
boot
your
Plan
9
guest
and
add
the
following
to
plan9.ini:
</p>

<pre>
audio0=type=sb16 port=0x220 irq=5 dma=5
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Before
trying
the
audio
feature,
you
must
reboot
your
Plan
9
guest
and
once
logged
in,
do:
</p>

<pre>
term% bind -a '#A' /dev
</pre>

<p class='para'>
Make
sure
the
rio
window
covers
a
significant
area
of
the
screen,
or
otherwise
the
audio
driver
seems
to
give
garbage
beeps
and
groans
instead
of
the
audio
you
want.
</p>

<pre>
term % cat a000 &gt; /dev/audio
</pre>

<p class='para'>
The
audio
that
comes
out
is
interrupted
by
short
and
frequent
timing
jitters.
When
you
resize
the
rio
window
while
the
audio
is
playing,
the
artifacts
go
away
for
awhile,
but
there
is
a
more
pronounced
interruption
during
the
resizing
operation.
