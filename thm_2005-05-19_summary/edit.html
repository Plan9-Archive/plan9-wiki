BRUCEE

(via [boyd]) OzInferno is done but release on hold until docs are

 *	"want to be able to attach gateway devices, etc. directly to it."

Interested in:
 *	authsrv for Linux
 *	plan9ports being split up more linux-like
 *	"split up the (p9p) components a bit so I can have people just
	grab the libraries and build environment to build synthetic file
	servers under Linux"

KURONEKO

(See [kuroneko] for details)

Sparc32:
 *	up to MMU mapping
 *	xalloc needs fixing
 *	needs multiple arbitary zone allocation

 *	/n/sources/contrib/ccollins/fs
 *	document build procedures

GDIAZ

9grid.org.es stalled due to workload.

Will talk to 20h about cross-domain auth.

MAJOR-WILLARD (BOYD)

Bad hand slowing work.

Compilers fix for to handle large macro expansions:
 *	"99.9% done. the 0.1% is subtle"
 *	cmd/8c and cmd/cc are on contrib/boyd

NASHI

Running tip9ug servers, "everyone behaves good on mordor."

Talking about multi authdom in tip9ug.

vt3 adds: "working on japanese fonts, finding security issues with
venti, just being modest"

OKSEL

Interested in USB work, modified usbd to automatically load usbmouse
when a mouse gets plugged in.

QUINTILE

Cifs, adding ntlmv2 auth, message signing, dfs support.

Seperating libasn1 from libsec, leading up to ldapfs, snmpfs and krb
in factotum.

Chatfs as a /net service providing msim, yahoo, jabber, etc.

All incomplete - published when ready.

RMILLER

Working on usb storage improvements soon.
 *	usb itself needs work as its too slow to be really usable for
	storage
 *	many devices don't boey the spec either
 *	poor performance attributed to "only being able to send one packet
	per usb frame"
 *	forsyth may be looking at usb as well
 *	usb booting should work if supported by bios(not sure about 9load)

RMINNICH

Port to Xen3.0
 *	goes really slowly

Working with vic zandy'x xcpu:
 *	"xcpu is really really nice"
 *	server for remote execution
 *	not released yet
 *	for lightweight cluster nodes.
 *	similar to linux bproc stuff

Strongarm
 *	enet driver has issue

Try to work with k8 once jmk releases initial kernel code.

RSC9

Wkj has almost working sshv2.

Working on venti rewrite:
 *	almost in a releaseable state
 *	jmk + rsc9 will be deploying a new venti to test it
 *	considerably faster than old venti
 *	p9p release first, then plan9 native
 *	available in the CVS as p9p

TMCM

Pointed out buffer overflow vulnerability report:
