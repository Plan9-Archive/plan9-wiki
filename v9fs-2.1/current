#The principal problems seen during v9fs-2.0 use is the difficulty in
#the setup of the server and performance problems associated with
#multiple extraneous copies in standard data flow. This is
#particularly the case when trying to optimize communication using
#intelligent networks or shared memory between virtualized partitions.

#
#As you can see from the above illustration, each white arrow
#involves a copy. Also, if you want to access a remote synthetic file
#system you end up traversing the v9fs layer multiple times.
#
#In version 2.1 we will try to address these problems by eliminating
#unnecessary copies from the transport path and moving portions of
#the server into the v9fs kernel code.

#
#In the 2.1 design we move the servers into the client allowing
#short-circuiting local access to synthetic file systems and
#resources including synthetic gateways to system devices. The main
#point is to help prevent multiple copies through user-space when
#exporting local devices (and synthetic gateways to those devices)
#through the server.
