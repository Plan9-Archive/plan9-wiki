VESA

has

distribution
and
the
kernel
has
new
PC
MMU
code
that
has
a
cleaner
separation
of
virtual
and
physical
addresses,
which
should
address
the
various
mmukmap2
panics
that

have
reported
over
the
years.
</p>

<p class='para'>
To
boot
one
of
these
new
kernels
you
will
need
to
copy
the
new
/386/9load
to
your
9fat
or
floppy
disk
so
that
it
can
cope
with
the
new
kernel
load
address.
(It
will
still
handle
the
old
ones
too.)

<p class='para'>
The
pc
kernels
use
the
BIOS
E820
memory
map
when
available
rather
than
poking
at
each
megabyte
until
they
decide
there's
no
more.
If
you
have
a
system
where
this
causes
problems,
you
can
put
"*noe820scan="
in

and
then
please
LET
US
KNOW
so
we
can

them.

Dept.
1127,
the
Computing
Science
Research
Center
at
Bell
Labs
and
the
birthplace
of
Unix
and
Plan
9,
has

up

management.
The

reorganization.

<p class='para'>
Sape
Mullender
wrote
to
9fans
to
reassure
that
Plan
9
work
continues:
</p>

<pre>
1127 ceased to exist some time ago.  The department was renamed and got a
much longer number which, of course, I can no longer remember.  The current
split of what's left of 1127 is not considered to be a big deal by most
members of the department.  There have always been many interdepartmental
collaborations, so 1127 has always been more of a management entity than a
group/club/fraternity.

[...]

Plan 9 is alive and reasonably well as our current vehicle for wireless 
systems research. Plan 9 has gone embedded (but rest assured, all our
wireless software runs in user space, using Plan 9's real-time scheduler to
make sure it runs when it needs to.

Using Plan 9, wireless code becomes useful in a fraction of the time that 
code can be made to run on all those commercial embedded operating systems
(which I do not care to mention) and also much quicker than on Linux which I
am sorry to say is just too large and illegible.
