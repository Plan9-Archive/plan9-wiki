Sources/contrib is a directory in the [sources repository] where
anyone can upload their Plan 9 related software. Things in
sources/contrib are not "officially" part of the Plan 9 distribution,
but are still very useful, they include ports of various Unix
software, documentation, scripts, experimental patches, etc.

To get your own directory in sources/contrib to upload your own code
see [how to contribute].

By convention, each contrib directory may have a README file, giving
the name and contact information of the author, license terms, or
other information, and an INDEX file, giving a brief description of
the individual elements in that directory.

The README and INDEX files are used to automatically generate the
[Contrib index] every morning. The README file is formatted for width
and the first 16 lines printed; an INDEX file can contain entries of
the form:
! package_name: Description here.

Where 'package_name' is a path to a file or directory relative to
that directory. INDEX files in the first two levels of directories
will be included in the wiki index; package_name can refer to files
at any level.

FGB'S CONTRIB

Another option is to use Federico G. Benavento's contrib package
management system. To install this system, issue

! /n/sources/contrib/fgb/root/rc/bin/contrib/install fgb/contrib

The [Contrib index] tells you the names of all users that have
packages available under this system. You can list all the packages
of a given user by stating

! contrib/list user

or details of a specific package with

! contrib/list user/package

To install a package, issue

! contrib/install user/package

See contrib(1) after installation for details.
