#Sources/contrib is a directory in the [sources repository] where
#anyone can upload their Plan 9 related software. Things in
#sources/contrib are not "officially" part of the Plan 9
#distribution, but are still very useful, they include ports of
#various Unix software, documentation, scripts, experimental patches,
#etc.
#
#To get your own directory in sources/contrib to upload your own code
#see [how to contribute].
#
#By convention, each contrib directory may have a README file, giving
#the name and contact information of the author, license terms, or
#other information, and an INDEX file, giving a brief description of
#the individual elements in that directory.
#
#The README and INDEX files are used to automatically generate the
#[Contrib index] every morning. The README file is formatted for
#width and the first 16 lines printed; an INDEX file can contain
#entries of the form:
#! package_name: Description here.
#
#Where 'package_name' is a path to a file or directory relative to
#that directory. INDEX files in the first two levels of directories
#will be included in the wiki index; package_name can refer to files
#at any level.

#FGB'S CONTRIB
#
#Another option is to use Federico G. Benavento's contrib package
#management system. To install this system, issue
#
#! /n/sources/contrib/fgb/root/rc/bin/contrib/install fgb/contrib
#
#The [Contrib index] tells you the names of all users that have
#packages available under this system. You can list all the packages
#of a given user by stating
#
#! contrib/list user
#
#or details of a specific package with
#
#! contrib/list user/package
#
#To install a package, issue
#
#! contrib/install user/package
#
#See contrib(1) after installation for details.
