Dns configuration notes

Asteve (195.173.15.12)
#First of all:
# *	Configure the network as explained in [Network configuration]
# *	Read the ndb(8) man page
#
#LOCAL DNS
#
#! ndb/dns -r
#
#You only need a
#!    dns = 1.1.1.1
#entry in your ipnet configuration ( see [Network configuration] )
#and that server will be used to answer dns queries.
#
#If you're using ip/ipconfig to configure your network via dhcp, dns
#entry will be automatically setup.
#
#INTERNAL DNS SERVER
#
#(normally used as a dns-cache to avoid waste on bandwidth with
#www.google.com queries :) ndb/dns -s)
#
#You need to use root dns servers directly, then you can answer all
#the names to your clients directly (they doesn't need to go out
#there to ask for them, so you saves bandwidth). You will need an
#entry like:
#! dom=
#!               ns=A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
#!               ns=B.ROOT-SERVERS.NET
#!          dom=A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET ip=198.41.0.4
#!          dom=B.ROOT-SERVERS.NET ip=128.9.0.107
#see /lib/ndb/local.complicated for a complete example.
#
#PRIMARY DNS SERVER
#
#(or master -> ndb/dns -s)
#
#You will need an entry like:
#
#! dom=cs.bell-labs.com soa=
#!              refresh=3600 ttl=3600
#!              ns=plan9.bell-labs.com
#!              ns=ns1.cs.bell-labs.com
#!              ns=ns2.cs.bell-labs.com
#!              mb=presotto@plan9.bell-labs.com
#!              mx=mail.research.bell-labs.com pref=20
#!              mx=plan9.bell-labs.com pref=10
#!              dnsslave=nslocum.cs.bell-labs.com
#!              dnsslave=vex.cs.bell-labs.com
#
#in your /lib/ndb/local file. You can see examples in
#/lib/ndb/local.complicated that comes with standard distribution.
#
#If you are familiar with DNS, you will find that entry
#self-explanatory. If not:
# *	ns - the name of your dns server, this should be defined with a
#	sys entry (see [Network configuration]). You can put all the ns
#	entries that serve your domain (master and slaves)
# *	mb - the email of the administrator
# *	mx adn pref - the mail exchanger (mx) and the preference (pref)
#	it has. The lower number is the one with more preference when
#	choosing a mail server.
# *	dnsslave - the name of your slave dns server (normally other
#	server). As far as i know you can't transfer zones to a Plan9 dns
#	server automatically, you can distribute your ndb file across your
#	plan9 servers via fs or use external tools to query a remote server
#	and write the appropiate ndb file. Steve Simon created such tool,
#	see on /n/sources/contrib/steve/zonefresh.tar.bz2.
# *	ttl and refresh - the defaults should be enought for normal setups
#
#If you have your zone entry ready, take a look at ndb file again to
#see if all the names you used in the zone definition can be resolved
#using ndb information (with entries like dom=plan9.bell-labs.com
#ip=1.1.1.1 or sys entries as described in [Network configuration] ).
#
#SLAVE DNS SERVER
#
#I never done that in plan9, but i suppose is like setting up a
#primary one. There is no options and no automatic transfer zone from
#a master to a Plan9 dns slave server.
#
#COMBINATIONS (AND NDB/DNS COMMAND)
#
#It is possible to use a mixture of those configurations. You only
#need to make all the entries you need in your ndb file and use the
#correct option to start your dns server:
#
# *	ndb/dns -r -> this will answer queries using a remote dns server
#	(or can use root servers entry)
# *	ndb/dns -s -> this will answer queries about your zones
# *	ndb/dns -sr -> this will answer queries about your zones, and
#	will answer queries about other names as well (can use root servers
#	entry)
# *	ndb/dns -snr -> this will do the same of he (-sr) and will update
#	the record of the dnsslaves when changed (you need this if use
#	dnsslaves)
# *	/rc/bin/service/tcp53 -> you will need enable this listener if
#	you want to transfer zones from a Plan9 dns server to unix slave
#	servers (normally move !tcp53 to tcp53 and restart the listeners)
#
#The ndb/dns command normally is executed via /rc/bin/cpurc, so take
#a look in this file for the ndb/dns line.
