Adding A New User

Creating a new user typically requires three steps:
 *	Create the user on the file server
 *	Create the user on the authentication server(not required for
	standalone terminals)
 *	When the user logs in the first time, he should execute
	/sys/lib/newuser

FILE SERVER

To create a new user, first create the user on the file server. When
running fossil(4), you can use

! con -l /srv/fscons

to connect to the file server console. To disconnect, type ctl-\ and
then type q at the >>> prompt. Type enter to see a prompt.

Fossilcons(8) describes the fossil console commands in detail. To
create a new user run(replacing <user> with the desired user name):

! uname <user> <user>

To allow the user to make changes to the system (configuration)
files, which are writable by group sys, add the user to sys:

! uname sys +<user>

And similarly if desired for the files in /adm:

! uname adm +<user>

If you are using the (old) WORM-based file server, the equivalent
commands are

! newuser <user>
! newuser sys +<user>

See fs(8) for details.

AUTH SERVER

If you are running a Plan 9 auth server, you will also need to create
an account on the authentication server, using auth/changeuser (see
auth(8)). This step is not required for a standalone machine.

SETUP

When the user logs in for the first time, he or she should run
/sys/lib/newuser to create a minimal Plan 9 home directory.
