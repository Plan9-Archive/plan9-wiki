GSoC Admin Expectations <i>-Diff-</i></h1>

<a href="index.html">Wed Feb 12 10:43:52 EST 2014</a>, a
</div><hr />In
GSoC,
Organization
Administrators
have
the
responsiblity
of
making
sure
the
organization's
involvement
in
the
program
goes
smoothly,
that
appropriate
communication
is
happening,
and
some
administrivia.
Here's
what
to
expect
from
your
org
admins.
<p class='para'>
This
year,
the
primary
admin
is
Anthony
Sorace;
the
backup
mentor
is
Erik
Quanstrom.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Organization
admins
will
complete
all
the
required
forms,
registration
materials,
organization
profiles,
and
so
on,
in
a
timely
manner.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Admins
will
follow
at
least
the
weekly
project
reports
from
students
and
mentors
to
ensure
work
is
progressing.
In
the
event
that
these
aren't
coming
in
as
expected,
admins
will
contact
the
mentors
first,
and
then
the
students
if
necessary.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Admins
will
actively
contact
each
mentor
on
a
weekly
basis
(most
likely
Monday
or
Tuesday,
after
the
weekly
status
reports
from
students
have
gone
out)
to
ensure
that
all's
going
well.
In
the
event
of
problems,
admins
will
take
corrective
action,
most
likely
communicating
with
the
backup
mentor(s)
and
then
the
students.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Admins
will
check
in
with
students
at
the
beginning
of
the
community
bonding
period,
the
beginning
of
the
code
period,
once
before
midterm,
and
once
a
week
or
so
before
the
suggested
"pencils
down"
date,
to
ensure
their
communications
with
their
mentors
are
going
well.
Admins
will
not
try
to
inject
themselves
into
the
student-mentor
relationship,
but
should
make
sure
the
student
is
having
a
productive
and
enjoyable
time.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
Admins
will
check
completion
of
student
and
mentor
midterm
and
final
reviews
and
will
provide
gentle
reminders
of
unfinished
forms
as
the
deadlines
near.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
In
the
event
both
the
primary
and
backup
mentors
become
unavailable,
org
admins
will
be
prepared
to
either
find
another
suitable
mentor
from
the
community
or,
as
a
last
resort,
serve
as
an
intermediary
to
the
community
generally.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
In
all
cases
above,
actions
to
be
performed
by
"admins"
will
be
expected
of
the
primary
admin,
with
the
backup
following
along
well
enough
to
pick
up
tasks
in
case
the
primary
gets
hit
by
a
bus
or
goes
awol.
</li>
</ul>
