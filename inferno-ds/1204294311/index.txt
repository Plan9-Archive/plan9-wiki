inferno-ds


OVERVIEW

There is an improving native port of Inferno for the Nintendo ds. It
is beginning to be functional, the framebuffer and touchscreen both
work. The system boots. However there's still a lot left to be done,
including wifi and floating point support. We're looking for a
student who has good low level knowledge and is interested in
implementing device drivers and/or higher level interfaces to the
more unique aspects of the DS(how to handle both screens etc...).

Anyone interested can find potential projects by going to the [main
project page | http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/source/list].
