TODO

Please list the software you are working (or plan to be working) on
in the first sections below. Listing the date and your name or email
address for contact would be good too.

The WISH LIST section below is for stuff in your to-do list that you
would like others to do.

IN PROGRESS

STUCK

 *	upas/fs modified to leave mail messages on remote media rather
	than loading them into RAM; see p9p's upas/fs.

 *	Making the fmt library more portable by safer use of varargs and
	adding %'d and %4$d POSIX extensions for internationalization. -- rob

 *	[9P2000.u] (9/2004) UNIX extensions to the 9P2000 protocol --
	[ericvh] & ron minnich

 *	[TinyGL | http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/TinyGL/]. A very light
	implementation of a subset of the OpenGL graphics library. Already
	ported to several non-X windowing environments -- mirtchov@cpsc,
	stalled, better shoot for the real thing and port MesaGL. This has
	also stalled for a year -- the software rendering compiles with
	ape/pcc, but the driver for draw() is half-done.

 *	[Coreboot | http://www.coreboot.org] Mods needed to get Plan9 to
	load directly from flash (no 9load) via Coreboot. Also see if I can
	get POST codes into the startup code -- makes debugging new
	platforms tons easier. No impact once the node is up.

 *	Read-only FFS (both UFS1 and UFS2) -- wkj

 *	Native port of GSL (GNU Scientific Library): numerical integration
	almost working, random distributions in progress -- -- [++pac]
	2005Apr29

 *	802.1x supplicant. in progress, /n/sources/contrib/axel/8021x .
	Only supports ttls-pap. I can now also test peap here; no clue yet
	whether it is worth to add support for it. --
	axel.belinfante@cs.utwente.nl

 *	DFS layer to go on top of aux/cifs - currently a working DFS
	client has been bodged into cifs, the separate layer will grow from
	this -- Steve

 *	Add client authentication to TLS in libsec -- ckeen

NEVER FINISHED

 *	Port to PowerPC iMac [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~412/projects/9mac/].
	Apparently stopped in 2005.

 *	PPC970 Port (in faith, haven't started yet, but going to shortly)
	-- [ericvh]

 *	htmlfmt to understand tables. - I am working on it now. You can
	find the latest update at /n/sources/contrib/pietro/htmlfmt.tgz --
	pietro

 *	IBM Research Hypervisor Support for x86/ppc kernels (11/2004) --
	[ericvh]

 *	64-bit MIPS port. Currently targeted towards SGI's R4K+ systems.
	-- tim at nop dot cx

HARDWARE DRIVERS IN PROGRESS

STALLED HARDWARE DRIVERS

 *	GigE driver for the SysKonnect family of cards (work in progress)
	-- cnielsen@pobox.com

 *	Broadcom BCM5751M Gigabit ethernet. George Gensure was working on
	this, see 9fans passim. [Overview |
	http://www.broadcom.com/collateral/pb/5751M-PB02-R.pdf]

 *	Centrino wifi driver, mostly written, needs to be finished, see
	/n/sources/contrib/rsc/ipw2200

WISH LIST

 *	x86 emulator to run the VESA BIOS on PCs, basic emulator already
	exists in /n/sources/contrib/rsc/8i. See x86emu.

 *	Implement some form of compression in devssl and devtls and make
	drawterm use it.

 *	tiff(1) in a similar vein to jpg(1), png(1) etc. Andrey has
	already ported libtiff see /n/sources/contrig/andrey/libtiff.tgz
	which should help.

 *	webdavfs - for MS Exchange

 *	Kerberos 5 client

 *	replica/pull to have a -m (3 way merge) option

 *	GUI image manipulation program - page(1) crossed with sam(1) which
	calls resample(1) and crop(1) (and other tools) [would love to see
	this implemented in Acme.... -- [++pac]

 *	A basic http/ftp proxy - maybe cache/regex advert stripping too.

 *	A new option to the fossil console snap command, allowing an
	already ingested vac score to be inserted into the /archive tree.

 *	cryptfs (see [http://www.crypto.com/papers/cfs.pdf]).

 *	GEOM-Based Disk Encryption (GBDE); see
	[http://phk.freebsd.dk/pubs/bsdcon-03.gbde.paper.pdf] and
	[http://lists.cse.psu.edu/archives/9fans/2005-February/040378.html].

 *	LDAP File System Server

 *	Linux binary emulator [linuxemu |
	http://pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~rsc/linuxemu.tar.gz] in theory, linuxemu
	ld-linux.so.1 bin/a.dynamic is supposed to work, but unfortunately
	ld-linux.so.1 wants to be loaded where the linuxemu text segment is.
	you'd need to move the linuxemu text segment somewhere else and then
	segdetach it before calling elfload. it's entirely doable,
	especially since x86 code is position independent. ... The libraries
	have changed since I did the initial work ... looks like there are
	new system calls to implement! -- Russ Cox

 *	Tk emulator/port.

 *	Input server for Chinese/Japanese/Korean.

 *	Some sort of user space emulator, like qemu, for Plan 9.

 *	A way for acme applications to set the 'scratch' flag (especially
	for win)

 *	Acme graphics capability & turning Acme to full UI Command window
	instead of menus, or taglines, everywhere. Maybe a single system cmd
	win connected to the last touched win -- [++pac]

 *	DOS binary emulator, just plain DOS, not Win -- [++pac]

 *	Fine-tuned mouse control (plenty of mice have more than three
	buttons and it would be nice to see Plan 9 be able to remap the
	buttons as desired). For example, I might want to have physical
	button #5 interpreted as someone pressing logical button #1.

HARDWARE DRIVERS WANTED

 *	XHCI, USB 3

 *	Bluetooth, probably via USB (see 9fans@hamnavoe.com and
	9nut@9netics.com)

	tables for secondary CPUs is working, early 2012.

 *	64-bit PowerPC compilers [done: forsyth@vitanuova.com; gradually
	moving into distrib]

 *	Currently at sources: /nemo Redirfs: Fail over from one file
	server to another. Working. Still on testing. --
	nemo@plan9.escet.urjc.es.

 *	A read-only version of upas/fs that you can export via 9P2000 to
	be used for people to browse/search 9fans and plan9dev without
	having to use Google: Use exportfs -R; the TIP9UG guys plan to set
	this up on their public servers.

 *	A port of AT&T GraphViz - open source graph drawing software (see
	[http://www.graphviz.org/]). Compiled graphviz-1.10 with mk and pcc
	(dot, neato, twopi). The plan9 source is at
	[http://www2.davidashen.net/graphviz-p9.tbz] -- dvd@davidashen.net

 *	64-bit (or 32-bit) version of /sys/src/fs with IDE DMA and RWM,
	Intel Gbe driver, longer filename components and more
	[http://www.collyer.net/sys/doc/fs64/fs.ps]. The distribution is
	[http://www.collyer.net/who/geoff/9/fs64.tgz]. -- geoff

 *	Unionfs. To merge several trees without binding each directory.
	For example, to make a patch for a read only media. (see [Divergefs])

	http://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/specupdt/30701418.pdf]

 *	USB disk support, allowing access to IPods and other usb storage
	devices.

 *	USB keyboard driver. (Some motherboards provide BIOS options to
	emulate USB keyboards as PS2 keyboards, but this doesn't work for
	everyone.)

 *	a mechanism to lock-focus in ACME (particularly for locking focus
	in the menu bars) to help make things more useable in the face of
	mouse drift: acme -b.

 *	cdfs capable of writing DVDs & Blu-ray discs.
