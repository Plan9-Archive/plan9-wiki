#The Plan 9 print spooler lp does not take the same arguments as the
#BSD lpr, nor as the lp that ships with some Unixes. It is worth
#reading the manual page lp(8) to get up to speed on useful options.
#The file /sys/lib/lp/devices contains example devices for printing
#to printers on parallel ports or BSD lpr-based queues.
#
#NON-POSTSCRIPT PRINTERS
#
#In the most recent releases, lp can send to any printer whose format
#is output by Ghostscript (in addition to the usual Postscript
#printers). If you have a Ghostscript-supported printer, use
#``gs!devicename'' instead of ``post'' or ``post2''. Follow the
#example for canonbjc240l in the devices file.
#
#NETWORK PRINTERS
#
#To print to printers that speak BSD lpr (such as those using HP
#JetDirect cards) follow the example for vogon in /sys/lib/lp/devices.
#
#Charles Forsyth has a small program and additions to lp to print to
#Microsoft SMB print servers. For the distribution, see
#[http://www.vitanuova.com/plan9/co/smb/index.html].
#
#Set your default printer destination using the enviroment variable:
#
#!         LPDEST
#
#FONTS
#
#Postscript printers may not have the correct fonts to print the
#Plan9 manual pages and documents. These can be downloaded
#automatically by the printer driver, you just need change the line:
#
#! @{bind -b $LPLIB/process /bin; $LPPROC} < $j | /$cputype/bin/aux/lpdsend ...
#
#in /sys/lib/lp/spooler/lpdspool by:
#
#! @{bind -b $LPLIB/process /bin; $LPPROC} < $j | aux/download -f -H/sys/lib/postscript/font -mfontmap -plw+ | /$cputype/bin/aux/lpdsend ...
