System Requirements
D1135529234
Agkscott (24.1.148.190)
#An x86-based PC with:
#
# *	32MB of RAM
# *	a supported video card (see [Supported PC hardware |
#	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/wiki/plan9/Supported_PC_hardware/index.html]).
# *	a hard disk with 300 MB of unpartitioned space with a free
#	primary partition slot
#
#These are the requirements for the installation procedure. A machine
#with 16MB of memory and no free disk space at all will work as a
#terminal but won't run the installer so you need a file server and
#auth server first.
#
#If you wish to install from local media, you need a FAT file system
#or a CD-ROM drive (and a CD writer or some other way to get the
#distribution archive on a CD). If you wish to install over the
#internet, you need a supported Ethernet card or a PPP dial-up
#account using a modem (not a Winmodem).
