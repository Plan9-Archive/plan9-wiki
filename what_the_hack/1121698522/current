#Glenda Village:
#
#A proposal, how it could be organised, in a scheme:
#
#[http://www.r-36.net/glendavillage.GIF] (base)
#
#[http://www.r-36.net/glendavillage_pwr_ntw.GIF] (power and network)
#
#[http://www.r-36.net/presentation_WTH.GIF] (inner presentation tent)
#
#A summary, what we would need:
# *	1 big presentation tent (MTG: 1x)
# *	a min of 5 boxes of good beer (20h: 2x)
# *	Ethernet switches (20h: 1x(8port); uriel 1x(5port))
# *	2 junction boxes (20h: 2x)
# *	1 long extension cable (getting to the main power supply)
# *	2 extension cables (20h: 1x)
# *	1 long CAT5 cable (getting to the main network)
# *	2 CAT5 at 10m each (connecting the switches and the main server)
#	(20h: 1x, uriel: 2x)
# *	2 picnic table (we get them from the organisers)
# *	1 camping table (Or do we still need some?)
# *	4 camping chairs (20h: 1x)
# *	enough duct tape (20h)
# *	some lights, because they still have day and night in the
#	Netherlands (20h: 1x)
# *	some way to do music(including speakers) (20h)
# *	some way to do multimedia (xscr on a beamer?)
# *	some CDs of Plan 9, Inferno and dtLinux to give them away(uriel:
#	15x of each)
# *	some tents, so it does not look like a dead town (20h: 1x, uriel:
#	2x)
# *	a way to keep the beer cool
# *	flag mast
# *	the flag (MTG: 2x)
# *	someone who has and can play a trumpet, for the every morning
#	flag flying
# *	A bottle of Kernel Hackers JackDaniels to drink to Boyd's
#	memory(uriel: 1x)
#
#The programme we could do:
#
# *	(always) support for Plan 9 and Inferno
# *	(always) help in installing Plan 9 and Inferno
# *	(some) talks about Plan 9, Inferno, 9grid or whatever topic you
#	want.
# *	(some) talks for Plan 9 and Inferno users
# *	micro-hackathons(try to get as much hacking done in X amount of
#	hours)
#
#The presentations could either be done over a beamer, on a
#whiteboard or by telling the listeners, where to find the PDF of the
#talk.
#
#Talks that could be done:
#
#20h:
# *	graphical programming in Plan 9
