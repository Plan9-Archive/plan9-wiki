WHY PLAN 9?

Why Plan 9 indeed. Isn't Plan 9 just another Unix clone? Who cares?

Plan 9 presents a consistent and easy to use interface. Once you've
settled in, there are very few surprises here. After I switched to
Linux from Windows 3.1, I noticed all manner of inconsistent behavior
in Windows 3.1 that Linux did not have. Switching to Plan 9 from
Linux highlighted just as much in Linux.

One reason Plan 9 can do this is that the Plan 9 group has had the
luxury of having an entire system, so problems can be fixed and
features added where they belong, rather than where they can be. For
example, there is no tty driver in the kernel. The window system
handles the nuances of terminal input.

If Plan 9 was just a really clean Unix clone, it might be worth
using, or it might not. The neat things start happening with
user-level file servers and per-process namespace. In Unix, /dev/tty
refers to the current window's output device, and means different
things to different processes. This is a special hack enabled by the
kernel for a single file. Plan 9 provides full-blown per-process
namespaces. In Plan 9 /dev/cons also refers to the current window's
output device, and means different things to different processes, but
the window system (or telnet daemon, or ssh daemon, or whatever)
arranges this, and does the same for /dev/mouse, /dev/text (the
contents of the current window), etc.

Since pieces of file tree can be provided by user-level servers, the
kernel need not know about things like DOS's FAT file system or
GNU/Linux's EXT2 file system or NFS, etc. Instead, user-level servers
provide this functionality when desired. In Plan 9, even FTP is
provided as a file server: you run ftpfs and the files on the server
appear in /n/ftp.

We need not stop at physical file systems, though. Other file servers
synthesize files that represent other resources. For example, upas/fs
presents your mail box as a file tree at /mail/fs/mbox. This models
the recursive structure of MIME messages especially well.

As another example, cdfs presents an audio or data CD as a file
system, one file per track. If it's a writable CD, copying new files
into the /mnt/cd/wa or /mnt/cd/wd directories does create new audio
or data tracks. Want to fixate the CD as audio or data? Remove one of
the directories.

Plan 9 fits well with a networked environment, files and directory
trees can be imported from other machines, and all resources are
files or directory trees, it's easy to share resources. Want to use a
different machine's sound card? Import its /dev/audio. Want to debug
processes that run on another machine? Import its /proc. Want to use
a network interface on another machine? Import its /net. And so on.
