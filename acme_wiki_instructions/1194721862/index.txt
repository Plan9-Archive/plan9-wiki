Acme Wiki instructions

If you want to access this site using Acme, have a look at
/acme/wiki/guide.

You can execute the first line to import the wiki,

! Local srv net!plan9.bell-labs.com!wiki wiki /mnt/wiki

and the third line to bring up the browser - though if you don't use
the latest version of acme you'll need to run a new instance of Acme
because Local doesn't import into the current namespace

! Wiki /mnt/wiki/

The browser should be fairly intuitive given familiarity with acme.

To follow wiki links, right-click page names inside square brackets:
[sandbox].

You can edit any wiki page, then click Put in the acme tag to save
your changes to the server.

To add a new wiki page, click New in the acme tag, then type the
title in the first line of the resulting window, followed by a
newline, then your content for the new page. Use [Wiki syntax] for
formatting.

You may need to add the following line to /lib/ndb/common to define
the default wiki file service TCP port:

! tcp=wiki port=17035

though this is defined in the distributed /lib/ndb/common as of Sept.
07.
