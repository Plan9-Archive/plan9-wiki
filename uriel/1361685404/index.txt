	comp.os.plan9?)
 *	issue/bug/task/feature tracking system? (bugfs?)
 *	9grid.net update
 *	Have http://public.www.planetmirror.com/pub/plan9/ updated

In progress:

 *	sources mirrors (20h, nashi, uriel,nemo)
 *	Better documentation, in particular document devlopment process
	and how to get involved. (uriel)
 *	Reduce split of codebases and documentation between p9p and Plan 9
	(oksel)
 *	Access to grid.plan9.bell-labs.com -> ericvh?
 *	New main page([rsc], uriel; almost done)
 *	[News] page/site (see news(1)?) -> Given up, see [NineTimes |
	http://ninetimes.cat-v.org] instead.

Done:
 *	[Add http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/fossil.pdf to papers page
	| http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/fossil/].
 *	Stablish procedure to get your own sources dir. See: [How to
	contribute]
 *	Monthly irc meetings. See: Town Hall Meetings
 *	Setup [Plan 9 Documentation Task Force]
 *	Have an automatically generated changelog and commits-list

Wont fix:
 *	Extend to use of patch(1) with comments for all changes done to
	the main distribution. The people at the Labs just wont do it.

------------------------------------------------------ 
TECH TODO

 *	Make awk work properly (use rc for system and |, errstr, exits,
	more things that I forgot)

BUGS

 *	HTML version of vgadb(6) and plan9.ini(8) are broken.
 *	cpp breaks when finding ' inside // comments
 *	cpp should ignore // ... at the end of #statements

------------------------------------------------------ 
WIKI TODO

Current wiki short term features:

 *	Make /n/sources/.. strings into links to the sources web
	interface(once it's up)
 *	Nested lists(syntax still not decided)
 *	Explicity syntax for headers and sub-headers(tentative syntax: <<
	Second header >>), this is needed by wikis in languages that don't
	use latin alphabets.
 *	Url-encode page names in the web interface.
 *	The web interface for the wiki seems to not set the proper header
	to avoid browser caching in the wrong cases(need to investigate
	exact causes).
 *	Script to check for broken wiki links
 *	Display missing pages nicely, ie., return only index.html for
	missing pages only on walk, might break something?

Maybe:
 *	A way to scape [[] and []] - I have a partial fix for this, that
	makes [[ not become a link(even when]] appears later in the same
	line), but I can't find a sane way to have it displayed as a single
	braket, specially in acme(could be done for HTML interface but would
	be an ugly hack).
 *	A way to force new lines - not sure how either, and probably not
	even a good idea.

Done:
 *	New css based style for web interface
 *	----- -> hr
 *	Relative links
 *	https links are broken (eg.
	[https://lists.cse.psu.edu/mailman/listinfo/9fans])
 *	Add extra info to [what's new]
 *	Replace "Edit" and "New" web pages with ones explaining that the
	web interface is disabled and acme is needed. (rsc removed the
	links, so not needed anymore)
 *	Better display of html diffs, show deleted and changed text.

Acme's Wiki features and bugs
 *	Better conflicting commit error reporting
 *	Make Zerox work properly, in particular edits in Zeroxed
	window(Maybe fixed by AxelB's fixes?)

------------------------------------------------------ 
TO MOVE TO SOURCES

 *	f2f's stuff (ffmpeg and xaos still missing?)
 *	pegasus, rit and latest python

------------------------------------------------------ 
MISC TODO

 *	New wiki/HIT
 *	Wikipedia Plan 9/Inferno related pages work, see
	[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lost.goblin]
