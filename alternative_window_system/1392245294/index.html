<div class='body'> <!-- ***************************** -->

The
graphics
system
in
Plan
9
is
very
different
than
folks
familiar
with
other
systems
are
used
to.
The
graphics
rendering
is
handled
by
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/3/draw"><i>draw</i>(3)</a>
device
driver,
while
the
control
of
those
windows
is
managed
by
another
program,
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/rio"><i>rio</i>(1)</a>.<hr />Rio
provides
a
very
clean,
minimal
interface,
with
very
little
window
decoration
and
only
two
very
small
menus.
It
does,
however,
embody
a
very
particular
set
of
ideas
about
how
to
deal
with
windows,
with
no
real
configurability.
For
some
users,
or
in
some
circumstances,
this
isn't
ideal.
Here
are
a
few
ideas
for
alternatives.
<ul>

<li>
More
"traditional"
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
For
some,
rio
represents
a
barrier
to
entry--complaints
that
it
is
hard
to
use
or
ugly
have
frequently
appeared.
It
would
be
nice
to
have
an
alternative
window
manager
for
those
people
who
don't
like
rio,
perhaps
something
with
more
traditional
title
bars,
minimize/maximize/close
buttons,
etc.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Grid-style
window
layout
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Rio
is
based
on
the
common
model
of
overlapping
windows.
Plan
9
also
has
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/acme"><i>acme</i>(1)</a>,
which
could
be
thought
of
as
a
text-only
windowing
system,
which
is
more
of
a
heirarchical
grid.
While
acme
itself
doesn't
handle
graphical
programs,
it's
inspired
(directly
or
indirectly)
various
X11
window
manager
with
a
tabular
view
of
graphical
windows,
such
as
dwm
and
wmii.
It
would
be
interesting
to
bring
those
ideas
home
to
Plan
9
in
the
form
of
a
rio
replacement.
Done
on
its
own,
this
would
likely
be
a
relatively
easy
and
isolated
set
of
internal
changes
in
rio.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
More
keyboard-driven
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Some
users
are
very
much
allergic
to
mouse-driven
interfaces,
for
whatever
reason.
It
wouldn't
be
hard
to
modify
rio
to
interpret
some
keyboard
input.
Basic
window
operations
like
new
and
hide
would
be
trivial;
more
interesting
would
be
a
clever
model
for
placement
and
resizing.
This
could
be
combined
with
one
(or
more?)
of
the
above
ideas
(dwm,
from
the
X11
world,
offers
a
particularly
interesting
combination
of
this
with
a
grid-based
layout).
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Different
physical
interface
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Rio
is
built
assuming
a
system
with
a
keyboard
and
3-button
mouse.
That
is
increasingly
not
a
great
assumption.
Genuine
3-button
mice
have
been
uncommon
for
a
long
time;
we
generally
get
two
real
buttons
and
a
scroll
wheel.
Then
there's
the
gaming
mice
with
some
higher
number
of
buttons.
There
are
other,
more
esoteric
input
devices,
like
the
Shuttle
Xpress/Pro.
Rio
either
ignores
these
or
pushes
them
into
the
3-button
mouse
model,
with
only
the
smallest
concessions.
It
would
be
interesting
to
explore
what
else
could
be
done
here
with
the
variety
of
optinos
available.
This
could
be
a
very
small
set
of
extensions,
up
through
something
much
more
ambitious.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Then,
of
course,
there's
touchscreens,
including
multi-touch
devices.
Pushing
those
into
a
3-button
mouse
model
gets
really
painful,
and
seriously
limits
the
effectiveness
of
Plan
9
in
those
environments.
An
alternative
really
is
called
for
here.
This
would
involve
a
lot
more
careful
thought
and
planning
up
front
to
determin
the
most
effective
model,
and
then
some
work
on
how
to
get
access
to
the
inputs,
before
addressing
things
in
the
rio
replacement
itself.
</p>
<hr />Contrib
on
sources
contains
a
number
of
smaller
hacks
that
folks
have
done
to
rio
to
push
the
boundaries
a
little.
It's
worth
taking
a
look
before
getting
started
on
something
new.
See
the
<a href="../../contrib_index">contrib
index</a>
itself.
<p class='para'>
We'll
shortly
add
a
summary
of
some
of
the
more
interesting
modifications
below.
