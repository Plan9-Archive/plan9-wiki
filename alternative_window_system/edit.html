The graphics system in Plan 9 is very different than folks familiar
with other systems are used to. The graphics rendering is handled by
the draw(3) device driver, while the control of those windows is
managed by another program, rio(1).

------------------------------------------------------ 
Rio provides a very clean, minimal interface, with very little window
decoration and only two very small menus. It does, however, embody a
very particular set of ideas about how to deal with windows, with no
real configurability. For some users, or in some circumstances, this
isn't ideal. Here are a few ideas for alternatives.

 *	More "traditional"

For some, rio represents a barrier to entry--complaints that it is
hard to use or ugly have frequently appeared. It would be nice to
have an alternative window manager for those people who don't like
rio, perhaps something with more traditional title bars,
minimize/maximize/close buttons, etc.

 *	Grid-style window layout

Rio is based on the common model of overlapping windows. Plan 9 also
has acme(1), which could be thought of as a text-only windowing
system, which is more of a heirarchical grid. While acme itself
doesn't handle graphical programs, it's inspired (directly or
indirectly) various X11 window manager with a tabular view of
graphical windows, such as dwm and wmii. It would be interesting to
bring those ideas home to Plan 9 in the form of a rio replacement.
Done on its own, this would likely be a relatively easy and isolated
set of internal changes in rio.

 *	More keyboard-driven

Some users are very much allergic to mouse-driven interfaces, for
whatever reason. It wouldn't be hard to modify rio to interpret some
keyboard input. Basic window operations like new and hide would be
trivial; more interesting would be a clever model for placement and
resizing. This could be combined with one (or more?) of the above
ideas (dwm, from the X11 world, offers a particularly interesting
combination of this with a grid-based layout).

 *	Different physical interface

Rio is built assuming a system with a keyboard and 3-button mouse.
That is increasingly not a great assumption. Genuine 3-button mice
have been uncommon for a long time; we generally get two real buttons
and a scroll wheel. Then there's the gaming mice with some higher
number of buttons. There are other, more esoteric input devices, like
the Shuttle Xpress/Pro. Rio either ignores these or pushes them into
the 3-button mouse model, with only the smallest concessions. It
would be interesting to explore what else could be done here with the
variety of optinos available. This could be a very small set of
extensions, up through something much more ambitious.

Then, of course, there's touchscreens, including multi-touch devices.
Pushing those into a 3-button mouse model gets really painful, and
seriously limits the effectiveness of Plan 9 in those environments.
An alternative really is called for here. This would involve a lot
more careful thought and planning up front to determin the most
effective model, and then some work on how to get access to the
inputs, before addressing things in the rio replacement itself.

------------------------------------------------------ 
Contrib on sources contains a number of smaller hacks that folks have
done to rio to push the boundaries a little. It's worth taking a look
before getting started on something new. See the [contrib index]
itself.

We'll shortly add a summary of some of the more interesting
modifications below.
