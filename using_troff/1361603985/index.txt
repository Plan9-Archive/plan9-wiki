Using troff

Troff formats text for printing or display. The troff language is not
usually used directly but through some intermediary. Commonly this
involves embedding the tags defined by the ms(6) macros into your
text document.

For example,

! troff -ms file

would output your text file with ms(6) macros as PostScript. Another
commonly used set of macros are for typesetting man(6) pages. To view
a typeset version of a manpage:

! troff -man /sys/man/4/factotum | page
