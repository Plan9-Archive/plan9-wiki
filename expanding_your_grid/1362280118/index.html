Plan
9
was
designed
as
a
distributed
system.
After
you
install
the
distribution
from
the
cd,
you
have
a
self-sufficient
one
machine
system,
a
standalone
terminal.
We
will
consider
this
as
"Level
0"
-
how
do
you
proceed
from
here
to
a
network
of
Plan
9
machines
and
provide
Plan
9
services
to
other
clients?
Note
that
this
guide
does
not
imply
a
strict
dependence
on
the
previous
level,
it
is
entirely
possible
to
setup
a
Plan
9
DHCP/PXE
boot
server
(described
in
level
7)
without
performing
all
the
steps
described
in
previous
levels.
This
is
a
rough
guide
which
proceeds
in
the
order
of
increasing
number
of
machines
used
and
increasing
elaboration
and
customization
of
configuration.
<a name="LEVEL_1:_UPGRADING_THE_INSTALL_TO_A_CPU_SERVER" /><h3>LEVEL 1: UPGRADING THE INSTALL TO A CPU SERVER</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
traditional
first
step
is
following
the
<a href="../../Configuring_a_Standalone_CPU_Server">Configuring
a
Standalone
CPU
Server</a>
wiki
page.
The
transformation
from
terminal
to
cpu
server
provides
many
additional
capabilities:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Remote
access
via
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/cpu"><i>cpu</i>(1)</a>

</li>

<li>

for
securing
network

</li>

<li>
Integration
with
other
operating
systems
via
Drawterm
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Even
if
you
are
only
planning
on
making
use
of
a
single
Plan
9
system,
it
is
highly
recommended
to
configure
it
as
a
cpu
server.
You
probably
use
other
operating
systems
as
well
as
Plan
9,
and
configuring
your
Plan
9
system
as
a
cpu
server
will
make
it
vastly
more
useful
to
you
by
enabling
it
to
share
resources
easily
with
non-Plan
9
systems.
</p>

<p class='para'>
It
should
also
be
noted
that
the
division
between
terminals
and
cpus
is
mostly
a
matter
of
conventional
behavior.
It
is
possible
to
configure
all
services
to
run
on
a
machine
using
the
terminal
kernel,
but
there
is
no
particular
advantage
to
this.
The
cpu
kernel
is
easy
to
compile
and
can
run
a
local
gui
and
be
used
as
a
combined
terminal/cpu
server.
</p>

<a name="LEVEL_2:_CPU_AND_DRAWTERM_CONNECTIONS_BETWEEN_MULTIPLE_MACHINES" /><h3>LEVEL 2: CPU AND DRAWTERM CONNECTIONS BETWEEN MULTIPLE MACHINES</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
core
functionality
of
a
cpu
server
is
to
provide
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/cpu"><i>cpu</i>(1)</a>
service
to
Plan
9
machines
and
Drawterm
clients
from
other
operating
systems.
The
basic
use
of
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/cpu"><i>cpu</i>(1)</a>
is
similar
to
ssh
in
unix
or
remote
desktop
in
Windows.
You
connect
to
the
remote
machine,
and
have
full
use
of
its
resources
from
your
terminal.
However,
Plan
9
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/cpu"><i>cpu</i>(1)</a>
also
makes
the
resources
of
the
terminal
available
to
the
cpu
at
/mnt/term.
This
sharing
of
namespace
is
actually
the
method
of
control
also,
because
the
cpu
accesses
the
terminal's
devices
(screen,
keyboard,
mouse)
by
binding
them
over
its
own
/dev.
If
you
are
a
new
Plan
9
user,
you
are
not
expected
to
understand
this.
</p>

<p class='para'>
Drawterm
from
other
operating
systems
behaves
the
same
way.
When
you
<a href="../../drawterm">drawterm</a>
to
a
Plan
9
cpu
server,
your
local
files
will
be
available
at
/mnt/term.
This
means
you
can
freely
copy
files
between
Plan
9
and
your
other
os
without
the
use
of
any
additional
protocols.
In
other
words,
when
working
with
drawterm,
your
environment
is
actually
a
composite
of
your
local
os
and
the
Plan
9
system
-
technically
it
is
a
three
node
grid,
because
the
Drawterm
program
acts
as
an
ultra-minimal
independent
Plan
9
terminal
system,
connecting
your
host
os
to
the
Plan
9
cpu
server.
</p>

<p class='para'>
For
many
home
users,
this
style
of
small
grid
matches
their
needs.
A
single
Plan
9
cpu/file/auth
server
functions
both
as
its
own
terminal,
and
provides
<a href="../../drawterm">drawterm</a>
access
to
integrate
with
other
operating
systems.
Some
users
like
to
add
another
light
terminal
only
Plan
9
system
as
well.
Recently
(2013)
Raspberry
Pi's
have
become
popular
for
this
purpose.
Another
option
with
surprising
benefits
is
using
virtual
machines
for
a
cpu
server.
Because
of
Plan
9's
network
transparency,
it
can
export
all
of
its
services
and
its
normal
working
environment
through
the
network.

<p class='para'>
A
standard

makes
use
of
a
separate
file
server
which
is
used
to
tcp
boot
at
least
one
cpu
server
and
possibly
additional
cpus
and
terminals.
A
tcp
booted
system
loads
its
kernel
and
then
attaches
to
a
root
file
server
from
the
network.
Some
of
the
strengths
of
the
Plan
9
design
become
more
apparent
when
multiple
machines
share
the
same

<li>
Hardware

is
optimized
by

role
(cpu/file/term)
</li>

<li>
New

require
almost
no
configuration
to
join
the
grid
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
If
you
have
already
configured
a
standalone
cpu
server,
it
can
also
act
as
a
file
server
if
you
instruct
its
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/fossil"><i>fossil</i>(4)</a>
to
listen
on
the
standard
port
564
for
9p
file
service.
Choosing
"tcp"
at
the
"root

option
during
bootup
allows
you
to
select
a
network
file
server.
You
can
use
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/plan9.ini"><i>plan9.ini</i>(8)</a>

A

<p class='para'>
The
first
time
you
work
at
a
terminal
and
make
use
of
a
cpu
server
when
both
terminal
and
cpu
are
sharing
a
root
fs
from
a
network
file
server
is
usually
an
"AHA!"
moment
for
understanding
the
full
Plan
9
design.
In
Plan
9
"everything
is
a
file"
and
the
9p
protocol
makes
all
filesystems
network

applications
and
system

the

message
passing
service
are
designed
with
distributed
architecture
in
mind.
A
terminal
and
cpu
both
sharing
a
root
fs
and
controlled
by
the
user
at
the
terminal
can
provide
a
unified
namespace

which
you
can
easily

exactly
what

running
on
which

<a name="LEVEL_4:_SHARING_/SRV_/PROC_AND_/DEV_BETWEEN_MULTIPLE_CPUS" /><h3>LEVEL 4: SHARING /SRV /PROC AND /DEV BETWEEN MULTIPLE CPUS</h3>

<p class='para'>
The
use
of
synthetic
(non-disk)
filesystems
to
provide
system
services
and
the
network
transparent
9p
protocol
allow
Plan
9
to
create
tightly
coupled
grids
of
machines.
This
is
the
point
at
which
Plan
9
surpasses
traditional
unix
-
in
traditional
unix,
many
resources
are
not
available
through
the
file
abstraction,
nfs
does
not
provide
access
to
synthetic
file
systems,
and
multiple
interfaces
and
abstractions
such
as
sockets
and
TTYs
must
be
managed
in
addition
to
the
nfs
protocol.
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
Plan
9
a
grid
of
cpus
simply
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/import"><i>import</i>(4)</a>
resources
from
other
machines,
and
processes
will
automatically
make

resources
if
they
appear
at
the
right
path
in
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/namespace"><i>namespace</i>(4)</a>.
The
most
important
file
trees
for
sharing
between
cpus
are
/srv,
/proc,
and
some
files
from
/dev
and
/mnt.
In
general
all
9p
services
running
on
a
machine
will
post
a
file
descriptor
in
/srv,
so
sharing
/srv
allows
machines
to
make
new
attaches
to
services
on
remote
machines
exactly
as
if
they
were
local.
The
/proc
filesystem
provides
management
and
information
about
running
processes
so
import
of
/proc
allows
remote
machines
to
control
each
other's
processes.
If
machines
need
to
make
use
of
each
other's
input
and
output
devices
(the

this)
access
is
possible
via
import
of
/dev.
Cpus
can
run

to
use

even
for

As

it
is

To
keep
a
full

backed-up,
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
keep
a
backup

The
rootscores
can
be
recovered
from
the
raw

data,
but
it
is
more
convenient
to
track
them
independently
for
faster
and
easier
recovery.
The
simplest
and
best
system
for
keeping
a
working
backup
is
keeping
a
second
active
venti
server
and
using
venti/wrarena
to
progressively
backup

them.
This
makes
your
backup
available
on

simply
by
formatting
a
new
fossil
using
a
saved
rootscore
and
setting
the
backup
venti

the
target.
If

The
9p
protocol
was
created
for
Plan
9
but
is
now
supported
by
software
and
libraries
in
many
other
operating
systems.
It
is
possible
to
provide
9p
access
to
both
files
and
execution
resources
on
non
Plan
9
systems.
For
instance,
Inferno
speaks
9p
(also
called
"styx"
within
Inferno)
and
can
run
commands
on
the
host
operating
system
with
its
"os"
command.
Thus
an
instance
of
Inferno
running
on
Windows
can
bring
those
resources
into
the
namespace
of
a
grid.
Another
example
is
using
plan9port,
the
unix
version
of
the
rc
shell,
and
9pfuse
to
import
a
<a href="../../hubfs">hubfs</a>

Plan
9
provides
mechanisms
to
manage
system
roles
and
bootup
from
a
DHCP/PXE
boot
server.
At
the
size
of
grid
used
by
an
institution
such
as
Bell
Labs
itself
or
a
university
research
department,
it
is
useful
to
separate
system
roles
as
much
as
possible
and
automate
their
assignment
by
having
Plan
9
function
to
assign
system
roles
and
ips
to
Plan
9
machines
via
pxe
boot
and
Plan
9
specific
dhcp
fields.
This
requires
configuring
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ndb"><i>ndb</i>(8)</a>
to
know
the
ethernet
addresses
of
client
machines
and
which
kernel
to
serve
them
and
a
well-controlled
local
network.
</p>

<p class='para'>
One
of
the
most
common
specialized
roles
in
a
mid-to
large
sized
grid
is
the
standalone
auth-only
server.
Because
auth
is
so
important
and
may
be
a
single
point
of
failure
of
a
grid,
as
well
as
for
security
reasons,
it
is
often
a
good
idea
to
make
the
auth
server
an
independent
standalone
box
which
runs
nothing
at
all
except
auth
services
and
is
hardened
and
secured
as
much
as
possible
against
failure
and
presents
the
minimal
attack
surface.
In
an
institution
with
semi-trusted
users
such
as
a
university,
the
auth
server
should
be
in
a
physically
separate
and
secure
location
from
user
terminals.
</p>

<p class='para'>
A
grid
of
this
size
will
probably
also
have
use
for
DNS
service.
For
personal
users
on
home
networks,
variables
such
as
the
authentication
domain
are
often
set
to
arbitrary
strings.
For
larger
grids
which
will
probably
connect
to
public
networks
at
some
nodes,
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/ndb"><i>ndb</i>(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/6/authsrv"><i>authsrv</i>(6)</a>

will
usually
be
coordinated
with
the
publicly
assigned
domain
names.
It
is
also
at
this
point
(public/private
interface)
where
machines
may
be
connected
to
multiple
networks
using
/net.alt
(simply
a
conventional
place
for
binding
another
network
interface
or
connection)
and
may
make
use
of
one
of
Plan

most
famous
applications
of
network
transparency
-
the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/import"><i>import</i>(4)</a>
of
/net
from
another
machine.
If
a
process
replaces
the
local
/net
with
a
remote
/net,
it
will
transparently
use
the
remote

In
its
role
as
a
research
operating
system,
the
capabilities
of
Plan
9
as
a
distributed
system
are
often
extended
by
specific
projects
for
specific
purposes
or
to
match
specific
hardware.
Plan
9
does
not
include
any
built-in
capability
for
things
like
task
dispatch
and
load
balancing
between
nodes.
The
Plan
9
approach
is
to
provide
the
cleanest
possible
set
of
supporting
abstractions
for
the
creation
of
whatever
type
of
high-level
clustering
you
wish
to
create.
Some
examples
of
research
grids
with
custom
software
and
capabilities:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
The
main
Bell
Labs
Murray
Hill
installation
includes
additional
software
and
extensive
location
specific
configuration
</li>

<li>
The
<a href="http://lsub.org">Laboratorio
de
Sistemas</a>
and
project
leader
Francisco
J
Ballesteros
(Nemo)
created
Plan
B
and
the
Octopus,
derived
from
Plan
9
and
Inferno
respectively.
</li>

<li>
The
<a href="http://xcpu.sourceforge.net">XCPU
project</a>
is
clustering
software
for
Plan
9
and
other
operating
systems
created
at
the
Los
Alamos
National
Laboratory
</li>

<li>
The
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/blue_gene">Plan
9
on
IBM
Blue
Gene</a>
project
utilizes
special
purpose
tools
to
let
Plan
9
control
the
architecture
of
the
IBM
Blue
Gene
L.
</li>

<li>
The
<a href="http://ants.9gridchan.org">ANTS</a>
Advanced
Namespace
ToolS
are
a
9gridchan
project
for
creating
failure-tolerant
grids
and
persistent
LAN/WAN
user
environments.
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
These
are
examples
of
projects
which
are
built
on
9p
and
the
Plan
9
design
and
customize
or
extend
the
operating
system
for
additional
clustering,
task
management,
and
specific
purposes.
The
flexibility
of
Plan
9
is
one
of
its
great
virtues.
Most
Plan
9
users
customize
their
setups
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
with
their
own
scripts
or
changes
to
the
default
configuration.
Even
if
you
aren't
aspiring
to
build
a
20-node
"Manta
Ray"
swarm
to
challenge
Nemo's
Octopus,
studying
these
larger
custom
systems
may
help
you
find
useful
customizations
for
your
own
system,
and
the
Plan
9
modular
design
means
that
some
of
the
software
tools
used
by
these
projects
are
independently
useful.

<p class='para'>
Because
existing
grids
already
have
the
label
"9grid"
it
is
theorized
the
as-yet
unreached
Ninth
Level
of
Gridding
corresponds
to
the
power
set
operation.
The
previously
described
eight
levels
of
gridding
already
encompass
an
infinite
Continuum
of
possibilities.
To
surpass
the
existing
level
requires
finding
a
way
to
construct
the
power
set
of
this
already
infinite
set.
Level
Nine
grids
are
therefore
transfinite,
not
merely
infinite,
and
it
is
an
open
question
if
current
physical
reality
could
accommodate
such
structures.
At
the
present
moment,
research
indicates
such
hypothetical
Level
Nine
grids
would
need
to
post
mountable
file
descriptors
from
quasars
and
pulsars
and
store
information
by
entropic
dissipation
through
black
hole
event
horizons.
