Plan
9
and
related
technologies
cover
a
huge
range
of
topics.
Below
we've
put
together
a
list
of
some
ideas
which
we
think
would
be
good
candidates
for
stundents
looking
for
summer-sized
projects
with
us.
Each
idea
includes
at
least
a
brief
description
and
a
list
of
"sponsors"
for
the
idea
(people
who've
suggested
it
or
volunteered
to
work
with
folks
on
it).
Ideas
are
rated
for
estimated
difficulty
from
1
to
5
stars
(1=easy,
5=hard)
and
may
contain
links
to
further
information
or
discussion.
<p class='para'>
Note!
Every
year
Plan
9
has
participated
in
GSoC
we've
accepted
student-submitted
projects
not
from
our
list,
and
that's
awesome.
You
are
highly
encourage
to
think
about
how
the
ideas
and
capabilities
of
Plan
9
(or
its
cousins)
could
be
used
to
solve
some
problem
you
care
about
and
submit
a
project
for
that.
We
are
especially
fond
of
things
that
present
their
solution
in
the
form
of
a
9p/styx
file
server.

Create
an
alternative
window

✪✪
(John
Floren,
Anthony
Sorace)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
For
some,
rio
represents
a
barrier
to
entry--complaints
that
it
is
hard
to
use
or
ugly
have
frequently
appeared.
It
would
be
nice
to
have
an
alternative
window
manager
for
those
people
who
don't
like
rio,
perhaps
something
with
more
traditional
title
bars,
minimize/maximize/close
buttons,
etc.
Rio
could
serve
as
a
base
for
this
effort
if
desired,
since
it
already
handles
the
necessary
multiplexing
and
drawing
operations.
</p>

<p class='para'>
A
related
but
different
approach
would
be
to
see
how
multi-touch
capable
devices
could
work
with
the
Plan
9
windowing
systems.
From
a
previous
GSoC
we
have
a
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/8/drawterm"><i>drawterm</i>(8)</a>
implementation
that
runs
on
iOS
devices
(it
could
use
some
refreshing),
and
more
recent
work
has
given
Plan9port
on
OS
X
some
multi-touch
recognition.
Still,
these
aren't
a
perfect
fit
for
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/rio"><i>rio</i>(1)</a>
and
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/acme"><i>acme</i>(1)</a>
as
they
exist
today.
</p>

<p class='para'>
In
either
case,
a
student
looking
to
work
on
these
projects
should
be
familiar
with
the
existing
Plan
9
windowing
systems.

Make

✪✪✪
(John

<p class='para'>
Libpanel
is
old
and
unmaintained,
libcontrol
doesn't
include
e.g.
a
multi-line

and
both

rather
outdated.
It
would
be
nice
to
have
a

including

drop-down

multiple-line
text
entry,
radio

scrollbars,

The
tk

in
Inferno

pretty
much
everything
desired.

There

a

modify

✪
(Erik
Quanstrom)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
Almost
no
truetype
fonts
provide
good
Unicode

and
good
quality.
Ttf2subf
is
a
Plan
9
Ports
program
for
turning
ttf
files
into
plan
9
fonts.
Since
a
single
subfont
in
plan
9
has
a
limited
size,
ttf2subf
tries
to
create
the
minimal
set
of
subfonts
possible
for
the
given
ttf.
This
results
in
subfonts
that
cross
Unicode
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt">block</a>
boundaries.
If
ttf2subf
instead
broke
fonts
at
block
boundaries,
similar
fonts
could
be
mixed
according
to
quality
and
coverage.

<p class='para'>
Give
hosted
Inferno
a
basic
interface
to
OpenGL
or
OpenVG
on
a
Linux

MacOS
host.
"Basic"
means
a
small
subset
of
OpenGL
or
OpenVG,
to
test
ideas
and
keep
the
project
manageable.
Ideally,
unlike
most
OpenGL
interfaces,
this
one
would
use
novelties
such
as
data
structures.
It
could
be
either
a
module
interface,
or
a
name

a

interface
to
a

(in
the
style
of
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/2/draw"><i>draw</i>(2)</a>).
For
GSoC,
best
to
keep
it
small
and
basic,
but
enough
to
draw
some
interesting
or
amusing
things.

The

faces

led

to
this,
most
especially

don't
release

It's

KVM/Virtio
Drivers
✪✪✪
(Eric
Van
Hensbergen)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
One
of
the
environments
many
people
run
Plan
9
under
is
Qemu/KVM
--
but
the
virtio
drivers
(which
are
required
for
high-performance
disk
or
network
access)
aren't
currently
supported
in
mainline
Plan
9.
The
student(s)
would
get
virtio
drivers
for
first
the
network
and
then
the
block
device
(or
perhaps
one
student
for
each)
working
and
in
a
form
suitable
for
acceptance
in
the
mainline
Plan
9
kernel
against
either
the
tip
Qemu
or
a
recent
Qemu/KVM
distribution
(say
Ubuntu
10.10).
I
believe
this
task
is
relatively
straightforward
and
requires
no
special
hardware
outside
of
a
PC
capable
of
running
Qemu.
If
there
was
sufficient
time
the
student
could
work
on
other
virtio
drivers
(native
9P,
console,
etc)
The
student
will
also
be
responsible
for
doing
a
base-level
performance
evaluation
of
virtio
drivers
versus
emulated
drivers
for
some
standard
operations
(disk
access,
fossil
access,
venti
access,
network
stream,
etc.)
The
cool
thing
is,
it'd
be
honest
kernel
work,
and
have
tangible
results
we
could
all
use
within
a
month
or
so
of
effort.

<p class='para'>
In

you
don't
need
NAT:
just
import

Sadly,
we
don't
live
in

world.
Write
what's
needed
to
allow
Plan
9
to
act
as
a

The
implementation
needs
to
support
the
TCP
mss
hack,
and
ftp.
This
can
be
implemented
in

If
performance
is
an
issue,
it

Check

Make
a
keyboard
file

✪
(Erik
Quanstrom,
Anthony
Sorace)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
There
are
several
cases
where
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
stand-alone
software
console.
The
in-kernel
console
(rightly)
doesn't
handle
interrupts
and
does
only
the
most
basic
keyboard
processing.
Other
software,
like
telnet,
implements
its
own
console
handling,
as
does
rio.
It
would
be
nice
to
refactor
this
into
a
stand-alone
file
server
that
handles
these
functions
and
could
be
used
by
all
these
functions,
or
directly
on
the
cga
console.

<ul>

<li>
Kernel.org
for
Plan
9
✪✪✪✪
(Ron
Minnich)
</li>
</ul>

<p class='para'>
The
Linux
kernel.org
provides
a
very
rich
environment
for
prototyping
linux
enhancements.
It
also
uses
a
well-known
SCM
(git)
which
removes
one
barrier
to
entry
for
new
users.
This
project
would
set
up
a
kernel.org-like
entity
that
uses
mercurial,
supports
forks,
and
has
a
well-defined
path
for
inclusion
into
the
base
"kernel.org"
repo.
It
would
also
support
a
process
for
regular
updates
from
sources.
Finally,
all
contrib
packages
would
be
included,
but
not
integrated
into
/sys/src
(to
make
pulls
from
sources
viable);
rather,
they
would
live
in
a
seperate
tree
called
/contrib
(both
source
and
binary).
Learning
the
lessons
from
kernel.org
is
strongly
encouraged,
but
implementing
this
system
in
a
Plan
9-friendly
manner
is
essential.
