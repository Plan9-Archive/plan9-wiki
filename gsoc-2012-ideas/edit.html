Plan 9 and related technologies cover a huge range of topics. Below
we've put together a list of some ideas which we think would be good
candidates for stundents looking for summer-sized projects with us.
Each idea includes at least a brief description and a list of
"sponsors" for the idea (people who've suggested it or volunteered to
work with folks on it). Ideas are rated for estimated difficulty from
1 to 5 stars (1=easy, 5=hard) and may contain links to further
information or discussion.

Note! Every year Plan 9 has participated in GSoC we've accepted
student-submitted projects not from our list, and that's awesome. You
are highly encourage to think about how the ideas and capabilities of
Plan 9 (or its cousins) could be used to solve some problem you care
about and submit a project for that. We are especially fond of things
that present their solution in the form of a 9p/styx file server.

In addition to this ideas page, prospective students should look over
our [GSoC Student Expectations] and be prepared to submit an
application matching our [GSoC Student Application]. For more
information, note our general [GSoC] page.

There is a separate list of [Inferno-related project ideas |
http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/wiki/Project_Suggestions] on
their site. Many may be larger than is suitable for GSoC, but they
might prove useful ideas. The ones that seem most suitable have been
included below.

 *	[Graphics / UI / draw(3)-related ideas | #GRAPHICS_IDEAS]
 *	[Kernel / port / low-level ideas | #KERNEL_IDEAS]
 *	[Web-related ideas | #WEB_IDEAS]
 *	[Compiler / dev tools / library ideas | #DEV_TOOLS_IDEAS]
 *	[Application ideas | #APPLICATION_IDEAS]
 *	[Other ideas | #OTHER_IDEAS]

------------------------------------------------------ 
GRAPHICS IDEAS

Ideas related to Plan 9's graphics systems, including kernel devices,
window systems, and supporting libraries.

 *	Create an alternative window manager ✪✪ (John Floren, Anthony
	Sorace)

For some, rio represents a barrier to entry--complaints that it is
hard to use or ugly have frequently appeared. It would be nice to
have an alternative window manager for those people who don't like
rio, perhaps something with more traditional title bars,
minimize/maximize/close buttons, etc. Rio could serve as a base for
this effort if desired, since it already handles the necessary
multiplexing and drawing operations.

A related but different approach would be to see how multi-touch
capable devices could work with the Plan 9 windowing systems. From a
previous GSoC we have a drawterm(8) implementation that runs on iOS
devices (it could use some refreshing), and more recent work has
given Plan9port on OS X some multi-touch recognition. Still, these
aren't a perfect fit for rio(1) and acme(1) as they exist today.

In either case, a student looking to work on these projects should be
familiar with the existing Plan 9 windowing systems.

 *	Make a widget library ✪✪✪ (John Floren)

Libpanel is old and unmaintained, libcontrol doesn't include e.g. a
multi-line text entry area, and both look rather outdated. It would
be nice to have a widget library including buttons, drop-down menus,
multiple-line text entry, radio buttons, scrollbars, etc. The tk
library in Inferno does pretty much everything desired.

 *	teach libdraw/libframe to deal with variable height fonts ✪✪✪✪
	(Erik Quanstrom)

The cannonical example is accented caps, such as u+0000c2, Â.

This would involve creating an analogue to stringwidth(2),
stringheight(2), and using the result in the frame(2) library.

 *	write a panning image viewer for plan 9. ✪✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

There are a few plan 9 programs like [gmap(1) |
http://www.quanstro.net/magic/man2html/1/gmap] and [radar(1) |
http://www.quanstro.net/magic/man2html/1/radar] that would benefit
from a panning viewer. The image-generating programs should provide
the panner enough information to generate adjacent images without any
private knowledge.

 *	modify ttf2subf to allow font combining. ✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

Almost no truetype fonts provide good Unicode coverage and good
quality. Ttf2subf is a Plan 9 Ports program for turning ttf files
into plan 9 fonts. Since a single subfont in plan 9 has a limited
size, ttf2subf tries to create the minimal set of subfonts possible
for the given ttf. This results in subfonts that cross Unicode [block
| http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt] boundaries. If
ttf2subf instead broke fonts at block boundaries, similar fonts could
be mixed according to quality and coverage.

 *	Hosted OpenGL in Inferno. ✪✪✪ (Charles Forsyth)

Give hosted Inferno a basic interface to OpenGL or OpenVG on a Linux
or MacOS host. "Basic" means a small subset of OpenGL or OpenVG, to
test ideas and keep the project manageable. Ideally, unlike most
OpenGL interfaces, this one would use novelties such as data
structures. It could be either a module interface, or a name space,
or a module interface to a name space (in the style of draw(2)). For
GSoC, best to keep it small and basic, but enough to draw some
interesting or amusing things.

This suggestion came from the Inferno ideas page.

------------------------------------------------------ 
KERNEL IDEAS

Project ideas related to the kernel, the various ports, or driver
support. Note that we're always interested in ports to new hardware,
provided you can ensure that you and your mentors have the same
device. Pick anything and get Plan 9 working on it!

 *	Port BSD NDISulator ✪✪✪✪ (Dave Eckhardt)

The NDISulator is a FreeBSD utility which facilitates using device
drivers for Windows network cards in FreeBSD. Plan 9 faces the same
problems that led the FreeBSD folks to this, most especially vendors
who don't release decent information on their parts. Port the
NDISulator so that we can use drivers written for Windows within Plan
9.
http://people.freebsd.org/~murray/presentations/20050429-msu-freebsd/img36.html http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/config-network-setup.html

 *	x2apic ✪✪✪✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

Erik has working xapic code that does cluster, flat and physical mode
and can handle 1 < n < 255 apics. It's not clear that x2apic is worth
it, but most of the fun would be in working out that problem on
24-core machines driving 10gbe. It's also not a very hard problem,
since it's mostly a matter of organization.

 *	pci extended configuration space ✪✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

Plan 9 currently has no access to pci extended configuration space.
[Wikipedia | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_configuration_space]
has a good overview of what extended configuration space is. The goal
would be to make extended-space access possible on as many machines
as possible.

 *	KVM/Virtio Drivers ✪✪✪ (Eric Van Hensbergen)

One of the environments many people run Plan 9 under is Qemu/KVM --
but the virtio drivers (which are required for high-performance disk
or network access) aren't currently supported in mainline Plan 9. The
student(s) would get virtio drivers for first the network and then
the block device (or perhaps one student for each) working and in a
form suitable for acceptance in the mainline Plan 9 kernel against
either the tip Qemu or a recent Qemu/KVM distribution (say Ubuntu
10.10). I believe this task is relatively straightforward and
requires no special hardware outside of a PC capable of running Qemu.
If there was sufficient time the student could work on other virtio
drivers (native 9P, console, etc) The student will also be
responsible for doing a base-level performance evaluation of virtio
drivers versus emulated drivers for some standard operations (disk
access, fossil access, venti access, network stream, etc.) The cool
thing is, it'd be honest kernel work, and have tangible results we
could all use within a month or so of effort.

Look in /n/sources/contrib/rminnich/lguest for some starting points

It is important that the student have Plan 9 experience for this
project and know how to compile and run their own kernels.

 *	NAT ✪✪✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

In Plan 9 (and Inferno) networks, you don't need NAT: just import the
gateway's network. Sadly, we don't live in a Plan 9-only world. Write
what's needed to allow Plan 9 to act as a NAT gateway for other
systems. The implementation needs to support the TCP mss hack, and
ftp. This can be implemented in user space. If performance is an
issue, it should be easy to move into the kernel if the student has
completed the work.

------------------------------------------------------ 
WEB IDEAS

Project ideas related to the web, either in Plan 9 tools providing
web services or in ways to interact with Plan 9 systems.

 *	Replace html generation in wikifs(4) ✪ (Anthony Sorace)

The wikifs(4) in both Plan 9 and Inferno understand a very small set
of cues when generating HTML. That set can be limiting. Replace it
with something better, like Markdown. Markdown engines in C already
exist, so the Plan 9 part of this shouldn't be too hard. I'd suggest
doing the Inferno version as well, to make it a good summer sized
project. Use any remaining time to convert any existing wiki docs
that need it.

 *	Make wikifs(4) authenticate against an auth server ✪✪ (Anthony
	Sorace)

Our wikifs(4) doesn't currently do any authentication. Our web server
and supporting libraries have support for http authentication, but
using data stored in the file system directly. It would be nice if
web applications could authenticate against a real Plan 9
authentication server. A student submitting a proposal for this
should also investigate what's involved in getting wikifs working
over https (it shouldn't be much) to ensure passwords are submitted
securely.

 *	A simple draw server for HTML5 browsers. ✪✪✪✪ (Skip Tavakkolian)

Adapt an existing Javascript implementation of Styx/9P to use HTML5
WebSockets -- or implement one from scratch -- and create a 9P file
server that provides a simple draw device using keyboard, mouse event
handling and either an SVG or a Canvas element for display. Develop a
Plan 9 or Inferno client to interact with it.

 *	Stateful Iferno httpd ✪✪✪ (Charles Forsyth)

Modify one of the Inferno httpd implementations to allow a process
(or a set of processes) to maintain state for a logical http session,
so the server-side application is written as a (fairly) normal
process. Write some useful applications.

Originally from the Inferno Idas page.

 *	Make Acme-sac's Charon use another acme(1) ✪✪ (Anthony Sorace)

The Inferno fork [Acme-sac | http://code.google.com/p/acme-sac/] has
a version of the web browser Charon which provides a text-only
interface via acme(4). For users who already run acme under Plan 9 or
Plan 9 from User Space, it is frustrating to have that separate. Make
the text-only charon interface work by importing the acme(4) file
system from Plan 9 or Plan 9 from User Space. Some extensions to the
target acme may be needed.

------------------------------------------------------ 
DEV TOOLS IDEAS

Project ideas related to compilers, development tools, or supporting
libraries.

 *	Get kencc to generate Windows object files ✪✪✪✪ (Steve Simon)

Plan 9's C compiler has generated other types of object files in the
past; it would be useful if it could generate things Windows
understands. This is a major undertaking as windows has a variety of
calling conventions and very different register use. However mingw
has tools to generate gcc compatible .a libraries which are very
similar to 8l ones. linking could initially be done with gld as. It's
noteworthy that the Go toolchain, which is derived from kencc (by
Ken!), can already do this.

 *	Native asn.1 DER encode/decode library ✪✪ (Steve Simon)

Write a native (non-APE) library for encoding and decoding ASN.1 DER
data. This is a useful step towards future LDAP work. This shouldn't
be too hard (and there's lots of reference code), but it will involve
reading lots of RFCs and testing.

 *	TLS/SSL3.0 in Inferno ✪✪✪ (Charles Forsyth)

From the Inferno Ideas page:

/appl/lib/crypt/ssl3.b has an implementation of SSL3(TLS),
/appl/lib/crypt/sslsession.b implements some form of SSL session
cache, and /*/port/devtls.c has support for the record structure and
control operations of SSL3 (but ssl3.b doesn't use it). Check ssl3.b
etc. against the specification, and change it to suit. You might also
need to change x509.b. (GW)

------------------------------------------------------ 
APPLICATION IDEAS

Ideas for applications; user-mode code in an existing environment.

 *	Implement tls 1.2 ✪✪ (Erik Quanstrom)

Plan 9 currently implements an older version of tls. Bring this
up-to-date with the current standards. This project will likely not
require as much code as reading of standards.

 *	Interact with Google APIs ✪✪ (Charles Forsyth)

Create file servers in (Plan 9 or Inferno) or modules (in Inferno) to
give access to some of the more interesting [Google APIs |
http://code.google.com/more/], where "more interesting" means you
also write a useful and/or amusing application that uses the API(s)
just implemnted.

Originally from the Inferno Ideas page, also applicable to Plan 9.

 *	Interact with Amazon's AWS APIs ✪✪ (Charles Forsyth)

Create file servers (in Plan 9 or Inferno) or modules (in Inferno) to
give access to the [Amazon Web Services APIs |
http://aws.amazon.com/], and write a useful and/or amusing
application that uses them.

Originally from the Inferno Ideas page, also applicable to Plan 9.

 *	A ProtoFS. ✪✪ (Skip Tavakkolian, Anthony Sorace)

Write a 9P file server that can be instructed to create a file tree
and associate each node with external directories, files or
processes. Very roughly, the prototype file tree instructions might
look something like:

! 	/
! 		fst/			= /usr/fst/www/
! 		edit/
! 			snarf		> /dev/snarf
! 			paste	< /dev/snarf
! 		mouse		| fd0rw /dev/mouse

 *	Make a keyboard file server ✪ (Erik Quanstrom, Anthony Sorace)

There are several cases where it would be useful to have a
stand-alone software console. The in-kernel console (rightly) doesn't
handle interrupts and does only the most basic keyboard processing.
Other software, like telnet, implements its own console handling, as
does rio. It would be nice to refactor this into a stand-alone file
server that handles these functions and could be used by all these
functions, or directly on the cga console.

------------------------------------------------------ 
OTHER IDEAS

Project ideas that don't fit into - or span multiple of - the above
catagories.

 *	Kernel.org for Plan 9 ✪✪✪✪ (Ron Minnich)

The Linux kernel.org provides a very rich environment for prototyping
linux enhancements. It also uses a well-known SCM (git) which removes
one barrier to entry for new users. This project would set up a
kernel.org-like entity that uses mercurial, supports forks, and has a
well-defined path for inclusion into the base "kernel.org" repo. It
would also support a process for regular updates from sources.
Finally, all contrib packages would be included, but not integrated
into /sys/src (to make pulls from sources viable); rather, they would
live in a seperate tree called /contrib (both source and binary).
Learning the lessons from kernel.org is strongly encouraged, but
implementing this system in a Plan 9-friendly manner is essential.

 *	Clean up eqn(1) output ✪ (Jeff Sickel)

Eqn has problems generating clean output for brackets and sqrt. This
is prevalent especially when using ps2pdf. Track down and fix the
errors so eqn | troff output is clean for publishing pdf papers.

 *	9P servers (Jeff Sickel (after reading an email from Charles))

Write a 9P server and supporting clients for relevant systems.
Suggested areas are:

 *	Atmel, Arduino
 *	dsPIC projects
 *	motor control systems
 *	Jtag
 *	Modbus
